"WP",2010,"Afghanistan","'The belief is that women are not important'; As Karzai's government considers negotiating with Taliban, retreat from hard-won progress is feared","-- The head-to-toe burqas that made women a faceless symbol of the Taliban's violently repressive rule are no longer required here. But many Afghan women say they still feel voiceless eight years into a war-torn democracy, and they point to government plans to forge peace with the Taliban as a prime example. Gender activists say they have been pressing the administration of President Hamid Karzai for a part in any deal-making with Taliban fighters and leaders, which is scheduled to be finalized at a summit in April. Instead, they said, they have been met with a silence that they see as a dispiriting reminder of the limits of progress Afghan women have made since 2001. ""We have not been approached by the government -- they never do,"" said Samira Hamidi, country director of the Afghan Women's Network, an umbrella group. ""The belief is that women are not important,'' she  said, describing a mind-set that she said ""has not been changed in the past eight years."" The Taliban's repressive treatment of women helped galvanize international opposition  in the 1990s, and by some measures democracy has revolutionized Afghan women's lives. Their worry now is not about a Taliban takeover, Hamidi said, but that male leaders, behind closed doors and desperate for peace, might not force Taliban leaders to accept, however grudgingly, that women's roles have changed. Those concerns share roots with the misgivings voiced by many observers, including some U.S. officials, about Afghan efforts to forge a settlement with the Taliban, whose leaders promote an Islamist ideology that seems wholly at odds with  rights  the Afghan constitution guarantees. The unease about such a settlement stretches from Kabul to the mountain-ringed valleys of Laghman, a scrappy town in a province still stalked at night by Taliban fighters. As a young girl here, Malalay Jan studied in a private home, hidden from the Taliban regime that forbade her education. Four years ago, her girls' school was torched in a rash of suspected Taliban attacks. Now, she said, she is sure of one thing: Afghan women should have a spot at the negotiating table. ""We don't want them to stop us from getting an education or working in an office,"" said Jan, 18, wearing a rhinestone-studded head scarf at her rebuilt school. Women, she said, should be ""the first priority."" Karzai, the Afghan president, has endorsed the idea of talking with all levels of the Taliban, and his aides insist that women need not worry about the equal rights  the Afghan constitution guarantees them. But they also say they are performing a difficult balancing act, and suggest that making bold statements about the sanctity of such topics as women's rights might kill talks before they start. ""We will act from a position of principle. And that principle is that half the public wants these rights to be protected,"" said Mohammad Masoom Stanekzai, who is drafting Karzai's reconciliation plan. ""It is not the authority of a group of people in government or a group of people in the insurgency to decide the fate of a whole nation."" In today's Afghanistan, females make up one-quarter of parliament, fill one-third of the nation's classrooms and even compete on ""Afghan Idol."" But  violence against women remains ""endemic,"" according to the  State Department. The percentage of female civil servants is steadily dropping. Just one of 25 cabinet members is a woman,  and female  lawmakers say their opinions are often ignored. That point was underscored in January, many  observers said, when the women's affairs minister was not invited to an international conference in London on reconciliation and reintegration. Bringing the Taliban into the government could make things worse, Hamidi said. ""They think women should stay at home,"" she said. ""And all of them have the same perception and same beliefs, from the lowest to the top level."" The Taliban itself, led by Mohammad Omar, has tried to dispute that. As part of what analysts call a public relations campaign to soften the movement's image, Omar, though still in hiding,  released a statement last fall that said the Taliban did not oppose women's rights and favored education for all. Arsala Rahmani, a  lawmaker and former Taliban government official, said he thought women's activists were being close-minded, defying what he called ""a mother's duty to always try to unite their sons."" He said that  the Taliban restricted women to protect them from conflict -- not out of ideological misogyny -- and that Omar and his fighters would accept any ideas the Afghan public favors. To human rights activists, those Taliban messages are ploys to dim support for U.S.-led military efforts in Afghanistan. They point to Taliban-dominated Kandahar province, where militants have closed two-thirds of schools, and Helmand, where tribal leaders say female teachers are threatened with death. It is a worrisome prospect to women such as  Khujesta Elham, an aspiring politician who on a recent day was chatting with friends between classes at Kabul University. She said she thought Taliban fighters should be shunned, though she did not expect that to happen. ""Whatever decision Karzai makes will be his alone,"" said Elham, 22. ""The government does not care about women's rights."" The depth of the Taliban's control varies across Afghanistan, as was the case during its  rule, and so do views on the movement. In the 1990s, the Taliban viewed Kabul as a den of depravity, and it was there that its notorious Vice and Virtue police most brutally wielded batons against women who exposed their faces or wore high heels. In Laghman, a rural Pashtun province in the shadow of snow-capped mountains, patriarchal traditions meant many of those rules were already in force. The area's Taliban officials mostly ignored unauthorized girls' schools, said Qamer Khujazada, who ran one until the Taliban was ousted in 2001. Khujazada  became principal of Haider Khani high school, but  militants burned down its administrative offices  four years ago. Hanifa Safia, the women's affairs representative for the province, said she thinks  a settlement is the only way to peace. The Taliban fighters who throw acid on schoolgirls' faces or threaten professional women do so just to antagonize the government, she said. ""I have talked to so many Taliban. They are not against women,"" Safia said. ""Once they have been given positions in government, they will definitely change."" Khujazada, the principal, tentatively agrees. She walks confidently through the halls of her fraying school, overseeing a staff that she boasts is exactly half female. But many of the girls slip into blue burqas before they leave the concrete-walled schoolyard,  and Khujazada acknowledged that most will be married off before they ever set foot in a university. What is important, she said, is that they have the right to continue their schooling. ""Education has a lot of friends,"" Khujazada said cautiously. ""But it has some enemies, too.""","-- The head-to-toe burqas that made women a faceless symbol of the 's violently repressive rule are no longer required here.

"NYT",2012,"France","3 American Women in Their Parisian Moments","The Paris Years of Jacqueline Bouvier Kennedy, Susan Sontag, and Angela Davis By Alice Kaplan Illustrated. 289 pages. The University of Chicago Press. $26. Alice Kaplan's ''Dreaming in French'' is an easy book to admire but a hard one to muster much enthusiasm for. It makes a half bang, like a wet firework that flickers colorfully but never rises from the ground. ''Dreaming in French'' is about the formative year that three ambitious and striking American women -- Jacqueline Bouvier, Susan Sontag and Angela Davis -- spent in Paris while in their 20s. Bouvier was there in 1949-50, while attending Vassar and a few years before she met the man who would make her the first lady. Ms. Davis spent 1963-4 in Paris while attending Brandeis. Both were French majors. Sontag, who spent 1957-8 in Paris, was, at 24, just a bit older when she went abroad. She was on a fellowship from the American Association of University Women. She'd left her husband, Philip Rieff, and their 5-year-old son in the United States, and once back home, she asked for a divorce. Ms. Kaplan is a professor of French at Yale University whose previous books (''French Lessons'' and ''The Collaborator'' among them) deserve their high reputations. She is alert to how different these women were. ''If you reduce them to identity labels,'' she writes, you have ''a Catholic debutante, a Jewish intellectual, an African-American revolutionary.'' These mighty women walking into a bar together could have been the opening of a Lenny Bruce joke. Ms. Kaplan is more interested in affinities. She seeks to capture Bouvier, Sontag and Ms. Davis at what she calls ''that existential threshold where you start to see what you can do with what you've been given.'' She notes, adroitly, that their stories ''have not had a place in the great American tradition of expatriate literature.'' The noisier boys -- Mailer, Plimpton, Baldwin, et al. -- and their adventures abroad have traditionally sucked up the oxygen in the room. The obstacle that Ms. Kaplan confronts in ''Dreaming in Paris'' is that these women did not leave a great deal behind in terms of written accounts of their Paris years. What little there is can seem larval. Ms. Kaplan writes around this murky zone. She dilates on the books these women read, the plays they saw, the shifting French intellectual climate. She is forced to utter broad generalizations, like, ''France gave each of these women a deep and lasting confidence, confirmed their spirit of adventure and guaranteed their freedom from home constraints.'' That's a pleasant enough sentence, but it could be written about a summer spent with Outward Bound. If ''Dreaming in French'' often seems like elegant grasping, there are few writers whom I'd rather grasp along with. Ms. Kaplan's prose is inquisitive and supple; she's never less than good company. Bouvier's family was obsessed with its supposed French origins, but Bouvier was only one-eighth French, Ms. Kaplan writes. Her year in Paris was a jarring mixture of worlds. She studied and spent time in cafes and museums with other young women in her program, but her life was also, Ms. Kaplan writes, a ''rush of chateaus, hunts and parties.'' Throughout her life Bouvier devoured French novels, watched French avant-garde films and followed French fashion. In the White House, President Kennedy received complaints from some in Congress that the couple were becoming ''too Frenchy.'' Her social secretary, Letitia Baldrige, reported the president phoning her to ask: ''What the hell was Potage aux vermicelles''? She replied that it was ''consomme with little things squiggling in it.'' Bouvier made a triumphant return to France in 1961, as first lady of the United States. At a news conference her husband said, ''I am the man who accompanied Jacqueline Kennedy to Paris.'' Sontag, who arrived in Paris for the 1957-58 academic year, later referred to herself as ''a self-Europeanized American.'' Her experience was far more raw and bohemian than Bouvier's. Allen Ginsberg was a neighbor. Sontag saw multiple films every day, read voraciously, hung out in bars as well as in cafes and had an intense sexual relationship with another American woman. She forever jettisoned the idea, Ms. Kaplan writes, ''that the life of the mind excluded bodily pleasures.'' Ms. Kaplan traces how, for Sontag, ''much of her own power and prestige in the United States -- her aura -- was connected to what she learned, then learned to transmit, from France.'' Sontag called Paris ''the alternative capital of my imagination,'' and when she died in 2004, her son, David Rieff, with no explicit instruction from her, took her to Paris to be buried. Ms. Davis arrived six years after Sontag, for the 1963-64 academic year. She'd grown up in racially segregated Birmingham, Ala., but her family had spent time in Manhattan, where she perfected her French at Elisabeth Irwin High School in Greenwich Village. She was in Paris during the Birmingham church bombings in 1963, combing The Paris Herald Tribune for news. She saw hints of racism in France, a country where black American artists had traditionally fled to escape the oppression they felt in the United States. About a pro-Algerian demonstration she saw on the Place de la Sorbonne, Ms. Davis wrote: ''When the flics broke it up with their high-power water hoses, they were as vicious as the redneck cops in Birmingham.'' After Ms. Davis was charged with murder, conspiracy and kidnapping for her role in the 1970 kidnapping and death of a California judge (she had purchased the weapons used in the crime), her case became a cause celebre among French writers and intellectuals like Jean Genet and Michel Foucault. They considered her one of their own. There was celebration in Paris when she was acquitted. ''Dreaming in French'' is itself a dreamy book, in ways both fuzzy and clarifying. It is always eloquent, however, about one thing: Learning a foreign language, as Bouvier put it, ''doubled life.''","The  Years of Jacqueline  , Susan , and Angela  By  Illustrated. 289 pages.

"NYT",2001,"Morocco","A NATION CHALLENGED: ISLAM; Where Muslim Traditions Meet Modernity","Islam preaches equality, yet in most Muslim countries a woman's place is determined by a man's will. It's the law. A husband can prevent his wife from traveling abroad, and the police will back up his legal right to stop her. A father can marry off his daughter against her will, and she, by law, must obey. A woman is trapped in a loveless marriage; with few exceptions, her husband is free once he declares himself divorced. But the days when Muslim women could be kept housebound, cosseted and remote from society are long gone in most parts of the Muslim world. As modernity collides with religious tradition, women have begun to demand a reinterpretation of the civil codes that presume a woman, in her private life, is a capricious creature in need of a man's guiding hand. The agitation in countries like Morocco is coming from female scholars who are confident of their religious judgment and use the Internet as a forum to promote an alternative vision of the rights of Muslim women. It is coming, as well, from politically active women who push for change from within Islamist movements. It is coming from ordinary women who fear that legal strictures will prevent their countries from integrating into the modern world. Their challenges to Islamic orthodoxy have placed these women at the heart of the main political battle in the Muslim world, where one side claims Islam as a shield against foreign culture and the other presents it as a road map for progress. To the extent there is public debate over the role of Islam -- as armor or emancipator -- that debate often turns on the subject of women. For many Muslim women, the religious laws that subordinate them to the authority of male relatives represent a final frontier. They already vote, unless they live in the gulf nations. They go to school, unless they lived under Taliban rule in Afghanistan. They choose whether or not to wear a veil, unless they live in Iran or Saudi Arabia. But in the personal sphere, laws remain mired in patriarchal tradition and a medieval reading of Islam. To alter them, Muslim women face not only an entrenched religious establishment, but also a battle with fundamentalists in the political arena. Many Muslim women say they do not want instructions for their struggle from the West. As they demonstrated at many international conferences on women's rights, they resent being told what it is they need. Still, in many countries, Islamist movements have attacked those seeking change as Western stooges and enemies of Islam, and they have seized on resistance to women's rights as an issue in their power struggle with moderate Muslim rulers. In Kuwait, Islamist members of Parliament rejected the emir's efforts to grant voting rights to women and pushed through a law to segregate Kuwait University. In Jordan, Islamists have campaigned successfully against the king's attempt to stiffen penalties for honor killings, or the murder of women whose behavior is deemed shameful to family honor. Nowhere in the Islamic world does the conflict over women's rights come into sharper relief than in Morocco, where society has split in two over a government proposal to eliminate inequities in the kingdom's laws. Last year, in a remarkable public demonstration, more than 400,000 people took to the streets in response to the plan. Half of them, marching in Rabat, supported the plan for equal rights. The other half, in Casablanca, rallied against it as an attack on religious values. The most contentious part of the proposal concerned the country's personal-status law, or moudawana, and the debate has become as much a political battle as a discussion of women's rights. The plan would raise the legal age for marriage to 18 from 15 for women (as it already is for men), outlaw polygamy in most cases and allow divorced women for the first time to retain custody of their children if they remarry. Women would also be granted equal rights to ask for a divorce and equal claims to assets acquired during the marriage, rather than just their personal property. Invasion of Ideas An Islamist dissident group, Justice and Spirituality, has organized the campaign against the plan. Led by Abdessalam Yassine, who accuses ""Westernized elites"" of destroying the Muslim world and its culture, the once-clandestine group has cast itself as the only line of defense against an invasion of foreign ideas. ""It's not that we don't want women to evolve,"" said Nadia Yassine, the leader's daughter and a spokeswoman. ""But we can't accept a plan simply because Westernized women with a Western mentality proposed it."" Under Moroccan law, a man can divorce his wife by simply declaring it in front of a judge. A woman is entitled to file for divorce only if she can prove her husband abuses her or fails to support her. Otherwise, she must buy her way out of a marriage by paying her husband any amount of money he demands. Unlike Mrs. Yassine, who said the moudawana does need adjustment, other Moroccan Islamists denounced the proposals as a threat to religion and family. The vehemence of the opposition took many supporters of the plan by surprise. ""The fundamentalists are fixated on the question of women, but they have no program,"" said Mohammed Said Saadi, a former minister of state and one of the authors of the plan. ""Their preoccupation is morality and they put out a lot of lies about the plan, saying it would encourage homosexual marriage, make condoms available everywhere and encourage the debauchery of high school girls."" In Morocco, the king is called ""commander of the faithful,"" making him the highest religious authority in the country. King Mohammed VI has called for the advancement of women. But he has not yet said whether he will endorse the plan on women, which would open a direct confrontation with the Islamist opposition. After the demonstrations in March 2000, he appointed a committee to sound out public opinion. It is still holding hearings. Many Moroccan women fear that the moudawana reforms will be put aside to avoid more political turmoil. ""And if you put that part aside, what's left?"" asked Fatiha Layadi, a stylish young television reporter who drew stares for smoking cigarettes in public at an outdoor cafe in Rabat. ""If it's not the whole package, then how are you going to talk about women's empowerment?"" Islam's Evolution Her frustration says much about the evolution of Islam. Born in the tribal societies of the Arabian Peninsula in the seventh century, Islam vastly improved the lot of women of that time. It instructed men that they could have up to four wives, but only if they treated all of them equally and had the means to support them. A woman could inherit wealth instead of being inherited as part of her husband's or father's estate. As codified over the years, however, Islam eventually institutionalized the inferiority of women. The prophet Muhammad is said to have urged his followers to treat women with respect, but respect has come to mean control. And while some scholars have argued that Islam was meant to be flexible enough to adjust to a changing society, conservatives have held sway for centuries. Muslim women now find themselves constrained by tradition as much as religious law. Saudi women are forbidden to drive, ostensibly to protect their Muslim honor, just as most Muslim women need a male relative's permission to get a passport. ""Our prophet made his own bed, sewed his own shirts, helped his wife at home,"" said Sibel Eraslan, a veiled Istanbul lawyer who once headed a women's committee in the Turkish Islamist party, Refah. ""Today men don't want to follow Muhammad because it is easier not to. Even the hard-line Islamists ignore these details from our prophet's life."" She, at least, lives in a country that recently changed its laws to give women equal rights in family life. But Turkey did so to aid its application to join the European Union, leaving Mrs. Eraslan uneasy with what she called ""imposed changes."" For women seeking change, however, there are reasons for optimism.  Women's votes can count, as they did in bringing a moderate president, Mohammad Khatami, to power in Iran in 1997. And traditionalists no longer control all the religious debate. ""Educated women armed with computers have defeated extremists by denying them a monopoly to define cultural identity and interpret religious texts,"" said Fatema Mernissi, a Moroccan sociologist who has written extensively on women and democracy in Islam. ""No extremist can say that women are inferior to men without being made a laughingstock on Al Jazeera,"" she added, referring to the Qatar-based satellite news channel. ""Islam insisted on equality between everyone."" Islamic jurisprudence is based on the Koran, which Muslims consider the word of God, and on the hadith, the prophet's words and actions as recorded after his death. Koranic verse is the basis for giving a woman's testimony half the weight of a man's. Laws limiting women's political role rely on the hadith, particularly one that attributes to the prophet a particularly damning view of women's abilities to lead. ""Those who entrust their affairs to a woman,"" he is believed to have said, ""will never know prosperity."" Women, of course, have led Muslim countries in Asia. But they have advanced no higher than government minister in modern Arab countries, in part because Arab scholars have not strayed far from the most literal interpretation of that hadith. Yusuf al Qaradawi, an Egyptian scholar whose opinions reach millions through his weekly call-in show on Al Jazeera television, has written that ""a woman's first and greatest job"" is to produce and raise children. If she must work, he says in his published religious rulings, it should only be in jobs where she would not spend time alone with a man or neglect her family duties. In the context of traditional religious rulings, the sheik's views might be considered progressive. But some religious women have begun to push the boundaries of even modernist male scholars. Among them is Suaad Salih, a professor of religious jurisprudence at Al Azhar University in Cairo, who considers herself as capable of issuing religious rulings as any man with the title sheik, which she does in unofficial forums. Last month, on Islam Online (www.islam-online.net), Dr. Salih tackled the Koranic verse about the testimony of women. The verse actually demonstrates Islam's respect for women, she wrote. ""In cases of crimes like murder and adultery, Islam makes it clear that in principle, a woman should be kept safe from all these fields that may hurt her feelings,"" Dr. Salih wrote. ""However, if no other one is there to witness except a woman, her testimony may be accepted in such cases in order to preserve the course of justice."" Force of Islam Articles in this series are examining growth in the influence of Islam. Later articles will focus on the place of Islam in a secular and democratic Turkish state and the Taliban and the concept of holy war. Articles in this series and related coverage are available at: nytimes.com"," preaches equality, yet in most  countries a woman's place is determined by a man's will. It's the law. A husband can prevent his wife from traveling abroad, and the police will back up his legal right to stop her. A father can marry off his daughter against her will, and she, by law, must obey. A woman is trapped in a loveless marriage; with few exceptions, her husband is free once he declares himself divorced. But the days when  women could be kept housebound, cosseted and remote from society are long gone in most parts of the  world. As modernity collides with religious tradition, women have begun to demand a reinterpretation of the civil codes that presume a woman, in her private life, is a capricious creature in need of a man's guiding hand. The agitation in countries like  is coming from female scholars who are confident of their religious judgment and use the Internet as a forum to promote an alternative vision of the rights of  women. It is coming, as well, from politically active women who push for change from within ist movements. It is coming from ordinary women who fear that legal strictures will prevent their countries from integrating into the modern world. Their challenges to ic orthodoxy have placed these women at the heart of the main political battle in the  world, where one side claims  as a shield against foreign culture and the other presents it as a road map for progress. To the extent there is public debate over the role of  -- as armor or emancipator -- that debate often turns on the subject of women. For many  women, the religious laws that subordinate them to the authority of male relatives represent a final frontier. They already vote, unless they live in the gulf nations. They go to school, unless they lived under  rule in . They choose whether or not to wear a veil, unless they live in  or . But in the personal sphere, laws remain mired in patriarchal tradition and a medieval reading of . To alter them,  women face not only an entrenched religious establishment, but also a battle with fundamentalists in the political arena. Many  women say they do not want instructions for their struggle from the West. As they demonstrated at many international conferences on women's rights, they resent being told what it is they need. Still, in many countries, ist movements have attacked those seeking change as Western stooges and enemies of , and they have seized on resistance to women's rights as an issue in their power struggle with moderate  rulers. In , ist members of  rejected the emir's efforts to grant voting rights to women and pushed through a law to segregate . In , ists have campaigned successfully against the king's attempt to stiffen penalties for honor killings, or the murder of women whose behavior is deemed shameful to family honor. Nowhere in the ic world does the conflict over women's rights come into sharper relief than in , where society has split in two over a government proposal to eliminate inequities in the kingdom's laws. Last year, in a remarkable public demonstration, more than 400,000 people took to the streets in response to the plan. Half of them, marching in , supported the plan for equal rights. The other half, in , rallied against it as an attack on religious values. The most contentious part of the proposal concerned the country's personal-status law, or moudawana, and the debate has become as much a political battle as a discussion of women's rights. The plan would raise the legal age for marriage to 18 from 15 for women (as it already is for men), outlaw polygamy in most cases and allow divorced women for the first time to retain custody of their children if they remarry. Women would also be granted equal rights to ask for a divorce and equal claims to assets acquired during the marriage, rather than just their personal property. Invasion of Ideas An ist dissident group, , has organized the campaign against the plan. Led by Abdessalam , who accuses ""Westernized elites"" of destroying the  world and its culture, the once-clandestine group has cast itself as the only line of defense against an invasion of foreign ideas. ""It's not that we don't want women to evolve,"" said , the leader's daughter and a spokeswoman. ""But we can't accept a plan simply because Westernized women with a Western mentality proposed it."" Under Moroccan law, a man can divorce his wife by simply declaring it in front of a judge. A woman is entitled to file for divorce only if she can prove her husband abuses her or fails to support her. Otherwise, she must buy her way out of a marriage by paying her husband any amount of money he demands. Unlike Mrs. , who said the moudawana does need adjustment, other Moroccan ists denounced the proposals as a threat to religion and family. The vehemence of the opposition took many supporters of the plan by surprise. ""The fundamentalists are fixated on the question of women, but they have no program,"" said , a former minister of state and one of the authors of the plan. ""Their preoccupation is morality and they put out a lot of lies about the plan, saying it would encourage homosexual marriage, make condoms available everywhere and encourage the debauchery of high school girls."" In , the king is called ""commander of the faithful,"" making him the highest religious authority in the country. King  has called for the advancement of women. But he has not yet said whether he will endorse the plan on women, which would open a direct confrontation with the ist opposition. After the demonstrations in March 2000, he appointed a committee to sound out public opinion. It is still holding hearings. Many Moroccan women fear that the moudawana reforms will be put aside to avoid more political turmoil. ""And if you put that part aside, what's left?"" asked , a stylish young television reporter who drew stares for smoking cigarettes in public at an outdoor cafe in . ""If it's not the whole package, then how are you going to talk about women's empowerment?"" 's Evolution Her frustration says much about the evolution of . Born in the tribal societies of the  in the seventh century,  vastly improved the lot of women of that time. It instructed men that they could have up to four wives, but only if they treated all of them equally and had the means to support them. A woman could inherit wealth instead of being inherited as part of her husband's or father's estate. As codified over the years, however,  eventually institutionalized the inferiority of women. The prophet  is said to have urged his followers to treat women with respect, but respect has come to mean control. And while some scholars have argued that  was meant to be flexible enough to adjust to a changing society, conservatives have held sway for centuries.  women now find themselves constrained by tradition as much as religious law. Saudi women are forbidden to drive, ostensibly to protect their  honor, just as most  women need a male relative's permission to get a passport. ""Our prophet made his own bed, sewed his own shirts, helped his wife at home,"" said , a veiled  lawyer who once headed a women's committee in the  ist party, . ""Today men don't want to follow  because it is easier not to. Even the hard-line ists ignore these details from our prophet's life."" She, at least, lives in a country that recently changed its laws to give women equal rights in family life. But  did so to aid its application to join the , leaving Mrs.  uneasy with what she called ""imposed changes."" For women seeking change, however, there are reasons for optimism.  Women's votes can count, as they did in bringing a moderate president, , to power in  in 1997. And traditionalists no longer control all the religious debate. ""Educated women armed with computers have defeated extremists by denying them a monopoly to define cultural identity and interpret religious texts,"" said , a Moroccan sociologist who has written extensively on women and democracy in . ""No extremist can say that women are inferior to men without being made a laughingstock on ,"" she added, referring to the Qatar-based satellite news channel. "" insisted on equality between everyone."" ic jurisprudence is based on the Koran, which s consider the word of God, and on the hadith, the prophet's words and actions as recorded after his death. Koranic verse is the basis for giving a woman's testimony half the weight of a man's. Laws limiting women's political role rely on the hadith, particularly one that attributes to the prophet a particularly damning view of women's abilities to lead. ""Those who entrust their affairs to a woman,"" he is believed to have said, ""will never know prosperity."" Women, of course, have led  countries in . But they have advanced no higher than government minister in modern  countries, in part because  scholars have not strayed far from the most literal interpretation of that hadith. , an Egyptian scholar whose opinions reach millions through his weekly call-in show on  television, has written that ""a woman's first and greatest job"" is to produce and raise children. If she must work, he says in his published religious rulings, it should only be in jobs where she would not spend time alone with a man or neglect her family duties. In the context of traditional religious rulings, the sheik's views might be considered progressive. But some religious women have begun to push the boundaries of even modernist male scholars. Among them is Suaad , a professor of religious jurisprudence at  in , who considers herself as capable of issuing religious rulings as any man with the title sheik, which she does in unofficial forums.

"NYT",2001,"Afghanistan","A NATION CHALLENGED: RIGHTS; In Bonn, Three Champions for Afghan Women","Sima Wali left Afghanistan 23 years ago when the Soviet Army swept into her country. Afghanistan was thrown into a downward spiral of violence, rivalry, civil war and harsh religious rule that finally forced Afghan women out of public life, jobs and education. ""In these 23 years, Afghan women have had to fight their own jihad for peace and equality,"" Ms. Wali said. ""It was a jihad, really. But it has also politicized Afghan women, even from behind the veil."" Ms. Wali, who settled in the United States and has worked to better the lives of Afghan women, is one of three women taking part as delegates in the United Nations talks here on a provisional government for post-Taliban Afghanistan. She and Rona Mansuri, who came to Germany in the 1960's when her father was Afghanistan's ambassador here, are delegates from the so-called Rome group, loyal to Afghanistan's former king, Mohammad Zahir Shah. Before he was deposed by a cousin in 1973 and moved to Rome, the king, now 87, ruled an Afghanistan in which women had important public roles as legislators and ambassadors. Under a 1964 Constitution, women were granted the right to work. Four then served as cabinet ministers and two others were members of the National Assembly -- a move into public life that accelerated during the 1979-89 Soviet occupation, when many women wore Western dress. Under Burhanuddin Rabbani, the titular head of the Northern Alliance who was president before the Taliban took over, women had to be accompanied by male relatives in public under restored old laws enforced by the new Islamic police. But under the Taliban, who took power in 1996, the status of women plunged. Education for those over 8 was banned and women were forced out of public life and jobs. Many were beaten for exposing their faces and some were publicly executed after accusations of sexual misconduct. The popularity of the former king now is partly the sense of a lost idyll, before Afghanistan spun apart. But Ms. Mansuri and Ms. Wali are using their positions to go beyond a return to the past. They are here to argue for women to take full and responsible roles in any future Afghan government -- and for the reaffirmation and protection of women's rights to equality. ""We are not waiting any longer to be invited to sit at these tables where peace is being discussed and the reconstruction of our economy,"" Ms. Wali said. ""We are the silent voices that need to be heard."" Pressure from the United Nations and the West, including the United States, was vital to get women as delegates here, Ms. Wali said. But now that she is in the room where the decisions are being made, she said, ""I'm a constant presence to raise the issue of women."" A third woman, Amena Safi Afzali, an exile now living in Iran, represents the Northern Alliance. Requests to interview her were not answered. Another exile, Fatima Gailani, is an adviser to the Peshawar group, who are mostly Pashtun. She comes from a prominent Afghan family, is the sister of the delegation's head, Sayed Hamed Gailani, and is married to another member of the delegation. She has studied Islamic law to better defend the rights of women, she says. She is articulate and open and not shy about her interest in a serious job in a new government. But she is realistic as well. ""If I go to Afghanistan today and ask women for votes on the promise to bring them secularism, they are going to tell me to go to hell,"" she said. ""So I will not say that. I will tell them that I would work for equal rights with men under an Islamic constitution. We can work from there."" Ms. Wali, the director of Refugee Women in Development, based in Washington, is also a founder of the Sisterhood Is Global Institute based in Montreal. She is an organizer of a conference on Afghan women scheduled to open in Brussels on Dec. 4. Ms. Wali persuaded both King Zahir and Mr. Rabbani to sign statements two weeks ago supporting the right of women to a full role in Afghanistan's political future. The most egregious restrictions on women are being relaxed in Kabul. Still, Ms. Wali is cautious about Mr. Rabbani's commitment to defend the rights of women ""within the context of Islam,"" she said. The statements must be backed by action, she said. She also appealed to Western women to understand that the real problems of Afghan women are ""extreme poverty and the number of widows who have no means to sustain themselves,"" cautioning that Afghans would not immediately strip off their veils and take full roles in public life. It is also important, she said, that ""Western women respect the right of Afghan women to choice, including the choice of keeping their chadors and burkas."" The Afghan women here got support today from some European Union legislators, who talked to the delegates about the importance of women's rights and called on their own governments to ensure a new Afghanistan that is open to everyone. ""Let us hope to see each member of the military forces followed by a teacher and a health worker,"" they said in a ""European women's declaration"" on these talks. When one of the legislators, Britt Theorin of Sweden, who heads the Equality Commission of the European Parliament, told the Afghan delegations that 40 percent of the seats in government should be held by women, she said, ""the women smiled, but the men said nothing."" Another European legislator, Emma Bonino of Italy, announced a one-day fast on Dec. 1 to support women in Afghanistan, and said that over 5,000 people from more than 100 countries had already agreed to take part. As for Ms. Wali, she said she intended to take part fully in Afghan political life. ""I've been working for the rights of Afghan women for 22 years,"" she said, ""and I do not intend to stop the struggle now.""","Sima  left  23 years ago when the Soviet Army swept into her country.  was thrown into a downward spiral of violence, rivalry, civil war and harsh religious rule that finally forced  women out of public life, jobs and education.

"NYT",2003,"Afghanistan","A New Democracy, Enshrined in Faith","In his admirable if overdue speech last week, President Bush acknowledged 60 years of American error and announced a new policy of encouraging democracy rather than dictatorship in the Muslim world. What Mr. Bush neglected to mention was that many Muslims, if freed to make their own democratic choices, will choose Islam over secularism. A case in point is the newly released draft of the Afghan constitution, which enshrines Islamic values even as it guarantees basic liberties. The document raises a crucial question that goes well beyond Afghanistan to the Muslim world as a whole: Can a nation be founded on both Islam and democracy without compromising on human rights and equality? If the answer is no, then democratization in places like Iraq and Afghanistan will be a pyrrhic victory -- we will have gotten rid of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein without their former victims actually achieving real freedom. If, however, a synthesis of Islam and democracy can satisfy devout Muslims, while at the same time protecting individual liberties and the rights of women and non-Muslims, then Islamic democracy may be the best hope for improvement in the Muslim world. Make no mistake: the Afghan constitution is pervasively Islamic. Its first three articles declare Afghanistan an Islamic Republic, make Islam the official religion, and announce that ""no law can be contrary to the sacred religion of Islam and the values of this constitution."" The new Supreme Court, which is given the power to interpret the constitution, is to be composed of a mix of judges trained either in secular law or in Islamic jurisprudence. The new flag features a prayer niche and pulpit, and is emblazoned with two Islamic credos: ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Prophet"" and ""Allah Akbar"" (""God is Great""). The government is charged with developing a unified school curriculum ""based on the provisions of the sacred religion of Islam, national culture, and in accordance with academic principles."" The provision requiring the state to ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the family calls, in the same breath, for ""elimination of traditions contrary to the principles of the sacred religion of Islam."" And yet, the draft constitution is also thoroughly democratic, promising government ""based on the people's will and democracy"" and guaranteeing citizens fundamental rights. One essential provision mandates that the state shall abide by the United Nations Charter, international treaties, all international conventions that Afghanistan has signed and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Because Afghanistan acceded in March to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women -- a treaty the United States Senate has never ratified -- the draft constitution guarantees women far-ranging rights against discrimination. It also ensures that women will make up at least 16.5 percent of the membership of the upper legislative house (only 14 of 100 United States senators are women.) In addition, the provision that makes Islam the nation's official religion also recognizes the right of non-Muslims ""to perform their religious ceremonies within the limits of the provisions of law."" This carefully chosen language might arguably leave room to restrict proselytizing -- as, for example, do similar laws in India and Israel -- but it nonetheless guarantees individual expression as an inviolable right. (It's worth noting that the right to change one's religion is enshrined in the human rights declaration.) Yes, if the draft is ratified by the grand assembly, or loya jirga, tensions in the constitutional structure will have to be resolved later by the Supreme Court. According to the draft, for instance, political parties must not be organized around a program contrary to Islam or the constitution. That would exclude an antidemocratic Taliban party; but would it also exclude a party of secularists who wanted to remove Islam from the constitution? What about laws requiring women to dress modestly: unconstitutional as a violation of women's rights, or constitutional as in accord with the teachings of Islam? The draft constitution gives guidance on all these questions, but the answers might well come down to the makeup of the Supreme Court: one dominated by illiberal religious scholars might interpret the text one way, while one with a majority of judges trained in the secular tradition might see it very differently. In its ambitions, attractions and dangers, the Afghan draft constitution can be seen as a metaphor for the wider prospects of Islamic democracy. Like the Afghan constitution, Islamic democracy has no chance if the West does not help create the economic prosperity and social stability for its success. After driving out the Taliban, the American-led coalition has done too little to bring Afghanistan under the control of a centralized government, nor has the United Nations presence in Kabul lessened the de facto control of the country by regional warlords. Unless America and the United Nations do more to buttress the sovereignty of an elected Afghan government, the constitution will inevitably become more of a symbol than an actual charter of governance. Similarly, unless America keeps steady pressure on Muslim countries to democratize -- rewarding meaningful elections and punishing human rights violations -- little progress will be made. The paradox, of course, is that if the people of Muslim countries do get a greater say in their own government, Islamic politics will likely prevail. Islamic parties speak the language of justice, the paramount political value to most Muslims. In some places -- Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia -- secular forces in the society counterbalance the rising Islamic politics. But in the Arab dictatorships, where secularist politics are associated with autocracy and graft, increased freedom will undoubtedly lead, at least in the short run, to new gains for political Islam. This leads some to say that we should not promote democracy in the Middle East lest we open the door to elections that might be, in the memorable words of a former assistant secretary of state, Edward Djerejian, ""one man, one vote, one time."" But calls to preserve the undemocratic status quo fail to acknowledge that the alternative to trying Islamic democracy may be much worse. It would be equally futile for the United States to unilaterally impose secularization in Afghanistan and Iraq. For a constitution to function, it must represent the will of its citizens. Nothing could delegitimize a constitution more quickly than America setting down secularist red lines in a well-meaning show of neo-imperialism. Rather, our goal must be to persuade a majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims that Islam and democracy are perfectly compatible. This will be especially true in Iraq, where the constitutional process must demonstrate to the Iraqi people and the rest of the world that the coalition intends to let Iraqis govern themselves. What's more, denying the possibility of democracy within Islam may bolster the case of Islamist radicals who, for very different reasons, claim that their religion and political freedom cannot mix. The draft Afghan constitution is just one possible picture of how Islam and democracy can live side-by-side in the same political vision. There are no guarantees in constitution writing or in nation building, and it is too soon to predict that the idea of Islamic democracy will take hold in practice -- in Afghanistan or elsewhere. All we can do is continue to press for democracy in the Muslim world: not because we naively expect a victory for secularism, but because freedom only makes sense as a value extended equally to all, to make of it what they will.","In his admirable if overdue speech last week, President  acknowledged 60 years of n error and announced a new policy of encouraging democracy rather than dictatorship in the Muslim world.

"NYT",2003,"Afghanistan","A New Democracy, Enshrined in Faith","In his admirable if overdue speech last week, President Bush acknowledged 60 years of American error and announced a new policy of encouraging democracy rather than dictatorship in the Muslim world. What Mr. Bush neglected to mention was that many Muslims, if freed to make their own democratic choices, will choose Islam over secularism. A case in point is the newly released draft of the Afghan constitution, which enshrines Islamic values even as it guarantees basic liberties. The document raises a crucial question that goes well beyond Afghanistan to the Muslim world as a whole: Can a nation be founded on both Islam and democracy without compromising on human rights and equality? If the answer is no, then democratization in places like Iraq and Afghanistan will be a pyrrhic victory -- we will have gotten rid of the Taliban and Saddam Hussein without their former victims actually achieving real freedom. If, however, a synthesis of Islam and democracy can satisfy devout Muslims, while at the same time protecting individual liberties and the rights of women and non-Muslims, then Islamic democracy may be the best hope for improvement in the Muslim world. Make no mistake: the Afghan constitution is pervasively Islamic. Its first three articles declare Afghanistan an Islamic Republic, make Islam the official religion, and announce that ""no law can be contrary to the sacred religion of Islam and the values of this constitution."" The new Supreme Court, which is given the power to interpret the constitution, is to be composed of a mix of judges trained either in secular law or in Islamic jurisprudence. The new flag features a prayer niche and pulpit, and is emblazoned with two Islamic credos: ""There is no God but Allah and Muhammad is his Prophet"" and ""Allah Akbar"" (""God is Great""). The government is charged with developing a unified school curriculum ""based on the provisions of the sacred religion of Islam, national culture, and in accordance with academic principles."" The provision requiring the state to ensure the physical and psychological well-being of the family calls, in the same breath, for ""elimination of traditions contrary to the principles of the sacred religion of Islam."" And yet, the draft constitution is also thoroughly democratic, promising government ""based on the people's will and democracy"" and guaranteeing citizens fundamental rights. One essential provision mandates that the state shall abide by the United Nations Charter, international treaties, all international conventions that Afghanistan has signed and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Because Afghanistan acceded in March to the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women -- a treaty the United States Senate has never ratified -- the draft constitution guarantees women far-ranging rights against discrimination. It also ensures that women will make up at least 16.5 percent of the membership of the upper legislative house (only 14 of 100 United States senators are women.) In addition, the provision that makes Islam the nation's official religion also recognizes the right of non-Muslims ""to perform their religious ceremonies within the limits of the provisions of law."" This carefully chosen language might arguably leave room to restrict proselytizing -- as, for example, do similar laws in India and Israel -- but it nonetheless guarantees individual expression as an inviolable right. (It's worth noting that the right to change one's religion is enshrined in the human rights declaration.) Yes, if the draft is ratified by the grand assembly, or loya jirga, tensions in the constitutional structure will have to be resolved later by the Supreme Court. According to the draft, for instance, political parties must not be organized around a program contrary to Islam or the constitution. That would exclude an antidemocratic Taliban party; but would it also exclude a party of secularists who wanted to remove Islam from the constitution? What about laws requiring women to dress modestly: unconstitutional as a violation of women's rights, or constitutional as in accord with the teachings of Islam? The draft constitution gives guidance on all these questions, but the answers might well come down to the makeup of the Supreme Court: one dominated by illiberal religious scholars might interpret the text one way, while one with a majority of judges trained in the secular tradition might see it very differently. In its ambitions, attractions and dangers, the Afghan draft constitution can be seen as a metaphor for the wider prospects of Islamic democracy. Like the Afghan constitution, Islamic democracy has no chance if the West does not help create the economic prosperity and social stability for its success. After driving out the Taliban, the American-led coalition has done too little to bring Afghanistan under the control of a centralized government, nor has the United Nations presence in Kabul lessened the de facto control of the country by regional warlords. Unless America and the United Nations do more to buttress the sovereignty of an elected Afghan government, the constitution will inevitably become more of a symbol than an actual charter of governance. Similarly, unless America keeps steady pressure on Muslim countries to democratize -- rewarding meaningful elections and punishing human rights violations -- little progress will be made. The paradox, of course, is that if the people of Muslim countries do get a greater say in their own government, Islamic politics will likely prevail. Islamic parties speak the language of justice, the paramount political value to most Muslims. In some places -- Turkey, Indonesia and Malaysia -- secular forces in the society counterbalance the rising Islamic politics. But in the Arab dictatorships, where secularist politics are associated with autocracy and graft, increased freedom will undoubtedly lead, at least in the short run, to new gains for political Islam. This leads some to say that we should not promote democracy in the Middle East lest we open the door to elections that might be, in the memorable words of a former assistant secretary of state, Edward Djerejian, ""one man, one vote, one time."" But calls to preserve the undemocratic status quo fail to acknowledge that the alternative to trying Islamic democracy may be much worse. It would be equally futile for the United States to unilaterally impose secularization in Afghanistan and Iraq. For a constitution to function, it must represent the will of its citizens. Nothing could delegitimize a constitution more quickly than America setting down secularist red lines in a well-meaning show of neo-imperialism. Rather, our goal must be to persuade a majority of the world's 1.2 billion Muslims that Islam and democracy are perfectly compatible. This will be especially true in Iraq, where the constitutional process must demonstrate to the Iraqi people and the rest of the world that the coalition intends to let Iraqis govern themselves. What's more, denying the possibility of democracy within Islam may bolster the case of Islamist radicals who, for very different reasons, claim that their religion and political freedom cannot mix. The draft Afghan constitution is just one possible picture of how Islam and democracy can live side-by-side in the same political vision. There are no guarantees in constitution writing or in nation building, and it is too soon to predict that the idea of Islamic democracy will take hold in practice -- in Afghanistan or elsewhere.

"NYT",1989,"France","A NEW PILL, A FIERCE BATTLE","WITH HIS MOP OF black hair and his brown ankle-high boots, Dr. Etienne-Emile Baulieu comes across at once as a different kind of scientist. His breezy, almost brash manner and hyperkinetic nature give him the air more of a populist politician than of a meticulous medical researcher, an expert in hormones at France's National Institute of Health and Medical Research. Indeed, nowadays Baulieu spends most of his time in what could be called a political campaign, hunched over the cream-colored telephone in his cluttered Paris office, arguing, cajoling and scheming. His crusade is aimed at winning acceptance for a revolutionary and highly controversial abortion pill known as RU 486. Created by Baulieu in conjunction with Groupe Roussel Uclaf, the French drug company for which he is a consultant, RU 486 is something that many women and many in the medical profession have awaited for centuries. Researchers say it could safely replace not only millions of legal surgical abortions but illegal back-street ones as well. ''Almost 50 million women have abortions each year, and some 150,000 women die annually from botched abortions,'' says Baulieu, in flowing but heavily accented English. ''RU 486 could save the lives of thousands of women.'' Although the 62-year-old endocrinologist would never admit it, his crusade to spread RU 486 is personal as well as political. RU 486 is the most important discovery of his distinguished career. Although as an employee of the Government-owned National Institute of Medical Research he does not stand to profit financially from RU 486, some predict that it could mean a Nobel Prize for him. This discovery and its consequences are perhaps equally important to another 62-year-old endocrinologist: Dr. Edouard Sakiz, Roussel's elegant, polished chairman. Sakiz, a close friend of Baulieu's since graduate-school days, is as careful and reserved as Baulieu is open and outspoken. A native of Turkey, where his father was a doctor, Sakiz came to Paris at the age of 20 to attend medical school and he quickly developed a reputation as an up-and-coming hormone researcher. He ultimately rose to the pinnacle of French corporate power, becoming chairman of Roussel, a $1.7 billion pharmaceutical group. Yet Sakiz's life has also been turned upside down by RU 486. Confronted with threats and demonstrations from anti-abortion protesters and pressures from Roussel's shareholders, Sakiz is a man at war with himself - the researcher who wants to push ahead with scientific progress locked in battle with the executive who would surrender scientific goals to protect his company. Last October, Baulieu and Sakiz found themselves the key players in an unusual chapter in corporate and medical history, when Roussel, which had the patent on one of the most important pharmaceutical advances in decades, decided to take that product off the market. The move sparked a bitter debate about the obligations a drug company has to scientific progress and to consumers - in this case, millions of women looking for a safer, less invasive form of abortion - and the obligations the company has to its shareholders. ETIENNE BAULIEU FIRST BECAME INTERESTED in fertility control in 1961, as a postgraduate researcher at Columbia University. It was then that he met Dr. Gregory G. Pincus, who in the 1950's had headed the team that developed the birth-control pill. Pincus took a liking to the 35-year-old Frenchman, who, as the first researcher to isolate one of the hormones in the adrenal gland, had already developed an international reputation. The magnetic Pincus quickly became Baulieu's idol. Baulieu is an informal, expansive man whose laboratory office reflects his creativity and complexity. Dominated by messy stacks of scientific papers, the room also houses works by his artist friends, including Niki de Saint Phalle. A seven-volume set of Louis Pasteur's collected works shares his bookshelves with a faded photograph of Gregory Pincus. For Baulieu, the quest that resulted in the abortion pill started in 1970, when his team of researchers at the national institute claimed victory in the fierce race to discover the receptors within the cells of the uterus that receive messages from the hormone progesterone. It is progesterone that signals the uterus to hold the fertilized egg. Without progesterone, gestation cannot occur. Although their work focused on the basic biology of hormones, Baulieu and his team quickly realized that it might be possible to use their knowledge of progesterone receptors to devise a method for blocking or terminating pregnancy. The idea was to find a substance that would prevent the uterus from receiving progesterone and thus prevent it from holding onto the fertilized egg. Baulieu decided to explore chemicals that would serve as progesterone impostors. They would latch onto the receptors and occupy them. But since they were phony they would never actually deliver the message that would enable the uterus to retain the fertilized egg. These impostor chemicals are called antihormones. ''The receptors are like a keyhole, and we were trying to produce a false key,'' explained Baulieu. To develop this compound, Baulieu suggested to Roussel's chemists that they try some biochemical legerdemain: graft a complex atom cluster onto a progesterone-like molecule to make it chemically different from progesterone, yet remarkably similar. In 1980, after several months of trying, Roussel's chief chemist, George Teutsch, performed this dazzling trick. Thus was born a molecule registered as Roussel Uclaf 38486, nicknamed RU 486 for short. By means of an intricate test that used radioactive isotopes, a centrifuge and ground-up rabbit uteri, the Roussel-Baulieu team soon discovered that this new compound fit perfectly into the progesterone receptor keyhole. ''I knew then that we had an important discovery,'' said Baulieu. ''I recognized that the ability to block progesterone - and thus pregnancy - was at hand.'' Baulieu sometimes gets lost in a monologue describing the discovery that made him famous. Yet he is eager to tell the world that his life's ambition has not been to perfect abortion. ''I'm not against children,'' said the Strasbourg native. ''I have three children and six grandchildren.'' FROM THE START, Sakiz was a fervent supporter of RU 486. In 1982, two years after RU 486 was created in the laboratory, he made an extraordinary move for a corporate chairman and joined Baulieu in signing the landmark scientific paper describing the first tests. These showed RU 486 had induced abortions in 9 of the 11 women who had agreed to participate in the study. The discovery was hailed at once as a breakthrough for women, especially those in the third world, where a shortage of doctors and sanitary surgical facilities make abortion particularly dangerous. Subsequent trials have shown that RU 486 - when taken in combination with another drug, prostaglandin, which induces uterine contractions - is more than 95 percent effective in terminating pregnancy in the first two months. Taken up to 49 days after the last menstrual period, it in effect causes a miscarriage, preventing the fertilized egg from implanting on the uterine wall or causing the uterine lining to shed eggs that have already implanted. Side effects include nausea, painful contractions and the bleeding typical of a miscarriage. When taken without prostaglandin, which is not recommended, RU 486 can result in incomplete abortion. The dosage is three tablets taken on consecutive days, at a total cost in France equivalent to $80. Last June, despite his early enthusiasm, Sakiz's support of RU 486 started to falter. Sakiz is a sensitive, courteous man, tall and wiry, with graying strawberry hair and light, bushy eyebrows. He had flourished in the rarefied environment of academia, at 26 becoming a top research assistant to a celebrated biologist at the College de France, an elite research institute. He has published dozens of scientific papers and, in 1969, at the age of 43, became head of Roussel's research department. He had no desire to be a martyr. But now, as Roussel awaited approval to market its new drug, Sakiz was hearing taunts outside his window, and receiving as many as 25 threatening letters a day. ''Assassins, stop your work of death,'' said one unsigned letter, scrawled in red ink. ''Your pill kills babies and you will suffer the consequences,'' said another. In front of Roussel headquarters, protestors distributed handbills calling RU 486 a ''chemical weapon'' that would ''poison the still-tiny children of a billion third world babies.'' ''The protesters told us, 'You are changing the uterus into a death oven,' '' Sakiz said during an interview in his personal conference room, which, with its burnished cherry-wood table, ornately carved doors and antique blue-and-white apothecary jars, is the essence of Old World civility. ''It's impossible to discuss things with these people,'' Sakiz continued, clasping and unclasping his long fingers as he talked. ''When you try arguments, all they say is you're killing babies.'' The tension mounted when hundreds of abortion opponents rallied in front of Roussel's headquarters on Boulevard des Invalides in Paris during the company's annual meeting last year, on June 23, where Sakiz was to announce a strong rebound in profits. Instead, Dr. Xavier Dor, a stern, charcoal-haired anatomy professor and abortion opponent, dominated the meeting, publicly haranguing Sakiz for 20 minutes. In France's genteel corporate world, such guerrilla tactics are a rarity, even if they have become a commonplace in the United States. These tactics quickly unnerved the intellectual and scientist in Sakiz. But his support of RU 486 was not to be shaken overnight, in part because his loyalty to Baulieu was deep-seated. When Sakiz returned to France in 1966, from a teaching job at Baylor University Medical School in Houston, it was Baulieu who recommended him for the post of director of biological research at Roussel - his first position at a company he was later to head. He was also haunted by what he saw as an early mistake by Roussel, when in the 1960's the company decided not to produce the contraceptive pill (a member of the steroid family), because it did not want to risk offending Catholic France. ''We lost the market for contraceptives even though we were the most important steroid company in the world,'' said Sakiz, ruefully. ''And now contraceptives are considered natural; they aren't at all controversial.'' As autumn approached, Sakiz continued to back RU 486, hoping the protests would disappear when France's Minister of Health, Claude Evin, ruled on Roussel's application to market RU 486. Sakiz believed the anti-abortion protests were aimed not so much at Roussel as at the minister, to pressure him to veto the pill. Meanwhile, from his office at Bicetre Hospital, used as an asylum and prison in the 17th century, on the outskirts of Paris, Baulieu lobbied discreetly among his friends at Roussel to urge them not to surrender to the right-to-life clamor. ''Dr. Sakiz was being extremely courageous,'' he recalled, as he peered out on the barren courtyard below. SAKIZ'S FRIENDS say it was not the anti-abortion protestors but intra-company pressures that finally caused him to cave in. Roussel, after all, had a parent company to answer to. Hankering for what the French call a ''petite danseuse,'' a little dancer, Hoechst A.G., the stolid West German chemicals giant, had first bought a stake in Roussel in 1968; it has since grown to 54.5 percent. Hoechst was attracted by the smaller company's expertise in biochemistry, and by its creativity and impulsiveness. But in the RU 486 affair, it appeared that Roussel was too creative and impulsive. Hoechst made it clear that RU 486 was no longer welcome, when the company's chief executive officer, Wolfgang Hilger, stated that an abortion pill violates the company's credo to support life. Hoechst also feared that boycott threats by the American anti-abortion movement could cripple Hoechst's $6-billion-a-year American subsidiary. ''Officials at Hoechst's American subsidary asked headquarters to get Roussel to cease and desist,'' says Sheldon Segal, director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation and a hard-fighting advocate of RU 486. Privately, Roussel officials said colleagues at Hoechst were dismayed by the right-to-lifers' taunts that Hoechst and Roussel were doing to fetuses what the Nazis had done to the Jews. I.G. Farben, Hoechst's ancestor company, manufactured cyanide gas for the death camps. THE KEY DEVELOPMENT that seemed to force Sakiz's about-face came when Alain Madec, an ambitious 41-year-old executive vice president, and the No. 3 man at Roussel, announced that he was against RU 486. He was the third of Roussel's five-man executive committee to throw his weight against the pill, joining two other executive vice presidents. Sakiz had withstood their opposition because they were due to retire soon. But with Madec's announcement, he began to worry that Madec might be currying favor with Hoechst to stage a palace coup. On Sept. 23, Minister of Health Evin gave Roussel the green light to market the pill. Instead of dissipating, as Sakiz had hoped, the protests crescendoed. Although the Catholic Church had expressed reservations earlier, now Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger, the Archbishop of Paris, condemned the pill publicly, calling it ''extremely dangerous.'' Roussel feared the church was whipping up a campaign against it. In the face of these pressures, Sakiz made an unexpected move. At an Oct. 21 meeting, he surprised members of the management committee by calling for a discussion of RU 486. There, in Roussel's ultra-modern board room, the pill's longstanding opponents repeated their objections: RU 486 could spark a painful boycott, it was hurting employee morale, management was devoting too much of its energy defending itself in this controversy. Finally, it would never be hugely profitable, because much would be sold on a cost basis to the third world. After two hours, Sakiz again stunned the committee by calling for a vote. When he raised his own hand in favor of suspending distribution of RU 486, it was clear that the pill was doomed. ''We have a responsibility in managing a company,'' he later explained in an interview. ''But if I were a lone scientist, I would have acted differently,'' he added, even afterward unable to keep his inner conflicts from bubbling to the surface. Baulieu was traveling that Friday, and it was not until the following Tuesday that he learned the news. A research assistant returning from Roussel's laboratories burst into his office at Bicetre Hospital to say that the company had just told its employees of the pill's suspension. Early that evening, Baulieu went to Sakiz's wood-paneled office for a heart-to-heart talk. ''I told him it was a big mistake,'' Baulieu recalled. ''I said, 'It's a bad decision for women's health. It's a bad decision for the future of medical research.' '' Sakiz was elegant, as usual, in a three-piece suit, Baulieu recalled, but he was uncharacteristically ill at ease. Baulieu, of course, had brought Sakiz into the company. But Roussel's chairman also knew that having Baulieu as a consultant not only added luster to his company, but had helped re-establish its leadership in hormone research. Yet Sakiz and other Roussel officials often resented Baulieu. They criticized him for grandstanding, for not giving Roussel enough credit for the discovery of RU 486, for being too outspoken about the pill's huge potential. They were outraged when he suggested publicly that RU 486 might be used as a once-a-month pill, which would have blurred the distinction between contraception and abortion. They felt he was feeding the right-to-life backlash. Nevertheless, Sakiz surprised his friend by now encouraging that same outspokenness. ''You're independent,'' he said. ''You can go out and speak freely.'' Sakiz was asking Baulieu to be what he could no longer be: a free man of conscience. ''I hope that the Government or public opinion will speak out,'' Baulieu recalled his friend as saying. ''Nobody has helped us.'' The next day, Oct. 26, Roussel informed the press that it was pulling RU 486 off the market, effective immediately, because of the ''polemic'' surrounding the pill. THAT DAY, 9,500 DOCTORS and researchers were gathering in Rio de Janeiro for the World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics. Roussel's decision created havoc at the meeting, ultimately turning it into a pep rally to rescue RU 486. ''There was a feeling of outrage,'' said Elisabeth Aubeny, a Parisian gynecologist who was selected to present Roussel with a 2,000-name petition protesting its move. Sheldon Segal of the Rockefeller Foundation attacked Roussel for ''betraying its partnership with the medical profession'' by pulling an important advance off the market. ''This is a tragic decision,'' added Allan G. Rosenfield, dean of the Columbia University School of Public Health, who said the world had eagerly awaited a pill that would avoid unnecessary deaths, and ''now it has been driven from the market by what amounts to a business decision.'' After his meeting with Sakiz, Baulieu had flown to Rio to head a panel discussion on RU 486. Mobbed by newspaper reporters and television cameras, he called a news conference for later that day, where he spoke perhaps more freely than Sakiz had wished: He condemned Roussel for surrendering to intolerance and called its decision ''morally scandalous.'' As doctors, scientists, feminists and family-planning groups protested Roussel's move, many began to ask how this important breakthrough could be brought to market. One suggestion was to set up a new company, perhaps a nonprofit one, to buy the patent - such a company would not have to worry that a boycott would hurt other product lines. Another proposal was that China - the only country other than France to have approved distribution of RU 486 - buy the patent and then manufacture the pill for the whole world. A third called for the World Health Organization, which had sponsored many tests of RU 486's safety and effectiveness, to distribute the pill if the company declined to do so. But the W.H.O. would face problems manufacturing and marketing RU 486, ''because we are not a pharmaceutical company,'' said Dr. Jose Barzelatto, director of human reproduction research. Roussel itself was reluctant to relinquish its patent because RU 486 was so promising in other areas, including fighting breast cancer and dilating the cervix, thus helping reduce the need for Caesarian births in the case of difficult or prolonged labor. There was also the possibility that Roussel might change its mind. Indeed, Pierre Joly, Roussel's vice chairman, hinted at this the day after the pill was suspended. In a radio interview, he said: ''We might resume distribution of RU 486 if the atmosphere becomes peaceful again.'' But the pill's supporters were not optimistic. Then, just two days after the pill was taken off the market, Health Minister Claude Evin summoned Joly to his office to say the Government would not stand for the suspension. Sakiz was on a routine business trip that day. Evin was angry that the company had pulled RU 486 off the market just four weeks after he had defied anti-abortion protestors and France's powerful bishops in order to approve Roussel's application to market RU 486. He also feared that if the anti-abortion movement came away triumphant from its crusade against Roussel, it would be emboldened to begin battling for the repeal of France's 1975 law legalizing abortion. The Government was not spoiling for such a fight. In an interview, Evin said, ''I was doing what I could to make sure France did not surrender to pressure groups animated by archaic ideologies.'' Evin told Joly that if the company did not reverse its decision, the Government -which owned a 36.25 percent stake in Roussel - would transfer the patent for RU 486 to another company. French patent law empowers the Government to make such transfers for the public good. ''I could not permit the abortion debate to deprive women of a product that represents medical progress,'' he said. ''From the moment Government approval for the drug was granted, RU 486 became the moral property of women, not just the property of the drug company.'' The Government's order delighted Sakiz. It was the trump card that defeated his opponents and took the onus off his company. Roussel officials had dropped RU 486 in part because they believed its future had become a public matter, too large for a private company to decide. Now the Government had decided the question for them. (Some opponents suggested that Evin and Sakiz had orchestrated this startling series of events beforehand. They deny this.) The Government's order ''helped us,'' said Sakiz. ''It showed the Government was on our side.'' And Joly added, ''We are relieved of the moral burden weighing on our group. For us, the problem is now solved.'' As a result of Evin's order, Roussel is distributing RU 486 to 350 hospital clinics in France. Since it was first introduced, more than 12,000 women have taken it worldwide. But, eager not to upset Hoechst, Roussel is not seeking to distribute its revolutionary pill outside of France. ''We're not eager to start a new debate,'' Dr. Sakiz admitted. Roussel is holding discussions with nonprofit organizations in the United States, Britain and Sweden, which would like to buy the pill at minimum cost from the company and distribute it in their home countries. Such a nonprofit group would take the heat from the anti-abortion movement -and, in the United States, the responsibility for obtaining Food and Drug Administration approval. Many supporters of the pill fear that in an effort to appease the right-to-life lobby, the Bush Administration F.D.A. might not approve RU 486. Not surprisingly, Baulieu is working feverishly to push these efforts to distribute the pill worldwide. And, as he campaigns week after week before television cameras and government panels to defend his discovery, he has embraced a second cause: to change abortion terminology as well. He rejects the term ''abortion pill'' to describe his discovery, asserting the word abortion is automatically negative and guilt-inducing. In his view, the process should be called ''contragestation,'' and his pill a ''contragestive,'' because it stops gestation. ''I resent when people present the very early interruption of pregnancy as killing a baby, morally or physically,'' he said. ''I think it's a crime to say that.'' He is confident that his campaign will succeed in the end, and his pill will be available to those who want it. ''You can't hold back scientific progress,'' he said. ''You can't put it back in the drawer.''","WITH HIS MOP OF black hair and his brown ankle-high boots, Dr.  comes across at once as a different kind of scientist. His breezy, almost brash manner and hyperkinetic nature give him the air more of a populist politician than of a meticulous medical researcher, an expert in hormones at 's . Indeed, nowadays  spends most of his time in what could be called a political campaign, hunched over the cream-colored telephone in his cluttered  office, arguing, cajoling and scheming. His crusade is aimed at winning acceptance for a revolutionary and highly controversial abortion pill known as RU 486. Created by  in conjunction with , the French drug company for which he is a consultant, RU 486 is something that many women and many in the medical profession have awaited for centuries. Researchers say it could safely replace not only millions of legal surgical abortions but illegal back-street ones as well. ''Almost 50 million women have abortions each year, and some 150,000 women die annually from botched abortions,'' says , in flowing but heavily accented English. ''RU 486 could save the lives of thousands of women.'' Although the 62-year-old endocrinologist would never admit it, his crusade to spread RU 486 is personal as well as political. RU 486 is the most important discovery of his distinguished career. Although as an employee of the Government-owned  he does not stand to profit financially from RU 486, some predict that it could mean a Nobel Prize for him. This discovery and its consequences are perhaps equally important to another 62-year-old endocrinologist: Dr. , 's elegant, polished chairman. , a close friend of 's since graduate-school days, is as careful and reserved as  is open and outspoken. A native of , where his father was a doctor,  came to  at the age of 20 to attend medical school and he quickly developed a reputation as an up-and-coming hormone researcher. He ultimately rose to the pinnacle of French corporate power, becoming chairman of , a $1.7 billion pharmaceutical group. Yet 's life has also been turned upside down by RU 486. Confronted with threats and demonstrations from anti-abortion protesters and pressures from 's shareholders,  is a man at war with himself - the researcher who wants to push ahead with scientific progress locked in battle with the executive who would surrender scientific goals to protect his company. Last October,  and  found themselves the key players in an unusual chapter in corporate and medical history, when , which had the patent on one of the most important pharmaceutical advances in decades, decided to take that product off the market. The move sparked a bitter debate about the obligations a drug company has to scientific progress and to consumers - in this case, millions of women looking for a safer, less invasive form of abortion - and the obligations the company has to its shareholders.  FIRST BECAME INTERESTED in fertility control in 1961, as a postgraduate researcher at . It was then that he met Dr. Gregory G. , who in the 1950's had headed the team that developed the birth-control pill.  took a liking to the 35-year-old Frenchman, who, as the first researcher to isolate one of the hormones in the adrenal gland, had already developed an international reputation. The magnetic  quickly became 's idol.  is an informal, expansive man whose laboratory office reflects his creativity and complexity. Dominated by messy stacks of scientific papers, the room also houses works by his artist friends, including . A seven-volume set of 's collected works shares his bookshelves with a faded photograph of Gregory . For , the quest that resulted in the abortion pill started in 1970, when his team of researchers at the  claimed victory in the fierce race to discover the receptors within the cells of the uterus that receive messages from the hormone progesterone. It is progesterone that signals the uterus to hold the fertilized egg. Without progesterone, gestation cannot occur. Although their work focused on the basic biology of hormones,  and his team quickly realized that it might be possible to use their knowledge of progesterone receptors to devise a method for blocking or terminating pregnancy. The idea was to find a substance that would prevent the uterus from receiving progesterone and thus prevent it from holding onto the fertilized egg.  decided to explore chemicals that would serve as progesterone impostors. They would latch onto the receptors and occupy them. But since they were phony they would never actually deliver the message that would enable the uterus to retain the fertilized egg. These impostor chemicals are called antihormones. ''The receptors are like a keyhole, and we were trying to produce a false key,'' explained . To develop this compound,  suggested to 's chemists that they try some biochemical legerdemain: graft a complex atom cluster onto a progesterone-like molecule to make it chemically different from progesterone, yet remarkably similar. In 1980, after several months of trying, 's chief chemist, , performed this dazzling trick. Thus was born a molecule registered as  38486, nicknamed RU 486 for short. By means of an intricate test that used radioactive isotopes, a centrifuge and ground-up rabbit uteri, the - team soon discovered that this new compound fit perfectly into the progesterone receptor keyhole. ''I knew then that we had an important discovery,'' said . ''I recognized that the ability to block progesterone - and thus pregnancy - was at hand.''  sometimes gets lost in a monologue describing the discovery that made him famous. Yet he is eager to tell the world that his life's ambition has not been to perfect abortion. ''I'm not against children,'' said the  native. ''I have three children and six grandchildren.'' FROM THE START,  was a fervent supporter of RU 486. In 1982, two years after RU 486 was created in the laboratory, he made an extraordinary move for a corporate chairman and joined  in signing the landmark scientific paper describing the first tests. These showed RU 486 had induced abortions in 9 of the 11 women who had agreed to participate in the study. The discovery was hailed at once as a breakthrough for women, especially those in the third world, where a shortage of doctors and sanitary surgical facilities make abortion particularly dangerous. Subsequent trials have shown that RU 486 - when taken in combination with another drug, prostaglandin, which induces uterine contractions - is more than 95 percent effective in terminating pregnancy in the first two months. Taken up to 49 days after the last menstrual period, it in effect causes a miscarriage, preventing the fertilized egg from implanting on the uterine wall or causing the uterine lining to shed eggs that have already implanted. Side effects include nausea, painful contractions and the bleeding typical of a miscarriage. When taken without prostaglandin, which is not recommended, RU 486 can result in incomplete abortion. The dosage is three tablets taken on consecutive days, at a total cost in  equivalent to $80. Last June, despite his early enthusiasm, 's support of RU 486 started to falter.  is a sensitive, courteous man, tall and wiry, with graying strawberry hair and light, bushy eyebrows. He had flourished in the rarefied environment of academia, at 26 becoming a top research assistant to a celebrated biologist at the College de , an elite research institute. He has published dozens of scientific papers and, in 1969, at the age of 43, became head of 's research department. He had no desire to be a martyr. But now, as  awaited approval to market its new drug,  was hearing taunts outside his window, and receiving as many as 25 threatening letters a day. ''Assassins, stop your work of death,'' said one unsigned letter, scrawled in red ink. ''Your pill kills babies and you will suffer the consequences,'' said another. In front of  headquarters, protestors distributed handbills calling RU 486 a ''chemical weapon'' that would ''poison the still-tiny children of a billion third world babies.'' ''The protesters told us, 'You are changing the uterus into a death oven,' ''  said during an interview in his personal conference room, which, with its burnished cherry-wood table, ornately carved doors and antique blue-and-white apothecary jars, is the essence of Old World civility. ''It's impossible to discuss things with these people,''  continued, clasping and unclasping his long fingers as he talked. ''When you try arguments, all they say is you're killing babies.'' The tension mounted when hundreds of abortion opponents rallied in front of 's headquarters on Boulevard des Invalides in  during the company's annual meeting last year, on June 23, where  was to announce a strong rebound in profits. Instead, Dr. Xavier Dor, a stern, charcoal-haired anatomy professor and abortion opponent, dominated the meeting, publicly haranguing  for 20 minutes. In 's genteel corporate world, such guerrilla tactics are a rarity, even if they have become a commonplace in the United States. These tactics quickly unnerved the intellectual and scientist in . But his support of RU 486 was not to be shaken overnight, in part because his loyalty to  was deep-seated. When  returned to  in 1966, from a teaching job at Baylor University Medical School in Houston, it was  who recommended him for the post of director of biological research at  - his first position at a company he was later to head. He was also haunted by what he saw as an early mistake by , when in the 1960's the company decided not to produce the contraceptive pill (a member of the steroid family), because it did not want to risk offending Catholic . ''We lost the market for contraceptives even though we were the most important steroid company in the world,'' said , ruefully. ''And now contraceptives are considered natural; they aren't at all controversial.'' As autumn approached,  continued to back RU 486, hoping the protests would disappear when 's Minister of Health, Claude Evin, ruled on 's application to market RU 486.  believed the anti-abortion protests were aimed not so much at  as at the minister, to pressure him to veto the pill. Meanwhile, from his office at Bicetre Hospital, used as an asylum and prison in the 17th century, on the outskirts of ,  lobbied discreetly among his friends at  to urge them not to surrender to the right-to-life clamor. ''Dr.  was being extremely courageous,'' he recalled, as he peered out on the barren courtyard below. SAKIZ'S FRIENDS say it was not the anti-abortion protestors but intra-company pressures that finally caused him to cave in. , after all, had a parent company to answer to. Hankering for what the French call a ''petite danseuse,'' a little dancer, Hoechst A.G., the stolid West German chemicals giant, had first bought a stake in  in 1968; it has since grown to 54.5 percent. Hoechst was attracted by the smaller company's expertise in biochemistry, and by its creativity and impulsiveness. But in the RU 486 affair, it appeared that  was too creative and impulsive. Hoechst made it clear that RU 486 was no longer welcome, when the company's chief executive officer, Wolfgang Hilger, stated that an abortion pill violates the company's credo to support life. Hoechst also feared that boycott threats by the American anti-abortion movement could cripple Hoechst's $6-billion-a-year American subsidiary. ''Officials at Hoechst's American subsidary asked headquarters to get  to cease and desist,'' says Sheldon Segal, director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation and a hard-fighting advocate of RU 486. Privately,  officials said colleagues at Hoechst were dismayed by the right-to-lifers' taunts that Hoechst and  were doing to fetuses what the Nazis had done to the Jews. I.G. Farben, Hoechst's ancestor company, manufactured cyanide gas for the death camps. THE KEY DEVELOPMENT that seemed to force 's about-face came when Alain Madec, an ambitious 41-year-old executive vice president, and the No. 3 man at , announced that he was against RU 486. He was the third of 's five-man executive committee to throw his weight against the pill, joining two other executive vice presidents.  had withstood their opposition because they were due to retire soon. But with Madec's announcement, he began to worry that Madec might be currying favor with Hoechst to stage a palace coup. On Sept. 23, Minister of Health Evin gave  the green light to market the pill. Instead of dissipating, as  had hoped, the protests crescendoed. Although the Catholic Church had expressed reservations earlier, now Jean-Marie Cardinal Lustiger, the Archbishop of , condemned the pill publicly, calling it ''extremely dangerous.''  feared the church was whipping up a campaign against it. In the face of these pressures,  made an unexpected move. At an Oct. 21 meeting, he surprised members of the management committee by calling for a discussion of RU 486. There, in 's ultra-modern board room, the pill's longstanding opponents repeated their objections: RU 486 could spark a painful boycott, it was hurting employee morale, management was devoting too much of its energy defending itself in this controversy. Finally, it would never be hugely profitable, because much would be sold on a cost basis to the third world. After two hours,  again stunned the committee by calling for a vote. When he raised his own hand in favor of suspending distribution of RU 486, it was clear that the pill was doomed. ''We have a responsibility in managing a company,'' he later explained in an interview. ''But if I were a lone scientist, I would have acted differently,'' he added, even afterward unable to keep his inner conflicts from bubbling to the surface.  was traveling that Friday, and it was not until the following Tuesday that he learned the news. A research assistant returning from 's laboratories burst into his office at Bicetre Hospital to say that the company had just told its employees of the pill's suspension. Early that evening,  went to 's wood-paneled office for a heart-to-heart talk. ''I told him it was a big mistake,''  recalled. ''I said, 'It's a bad decision for women's health. It's a bad decision for the future of medical research.' ''  was elegant, as usual, in a three-piece suit,  recalled, but he was uncharacteristically ill at ease. , of course, had brought  into the company. But 's chairman also knew that having  as a consultant not only added luster to his company, but had helped re-establish its leadership in hormone research. Yet  and other  officials often resented . They criticized him for grandstanding, for not giving  enough credit for the discovery of RU 486, for being too outspoken about the pill's huge potential. They were outraged when he suggested publicly that RU 486 might be used as a once-a-month pill, which would have blurred the distinction between contraception and abortion. They felt he was feeding the right-to-life backlash. Nevertheless,  surprised his friend by now encouraging that same outspokenness. ''You're independent,'' he said. ''You can go out and speak freely.''  was asking  to be what he could no longer be: a free man of conscience. ''I hope that the Government or public opinion will speak out,''  recalled his friend as saying. ''Nobody has helped us.'' The next day, Oct. 26,  informed the press that it was pulling RU 486 off the market, effective immediately, because of the ''polemic'' surrounding the pill. THAT DAY, 9,500 DOCTORS and researchers were gathering in Rio de Janeiro for the World Congress of Gynecology and Obstetrics. 's decision created havoc at the meeting, ultimately turning it into a pep rally to rescue RU 486. ''There was a feeling of outrage,'' said Elisabeth Aubeny, a ian gynecologist who was selected to present  with a 2,000-name petition protesting its move. Sheldon Segal of the Rockefeller Foundation attacked  for ''betraying its partnership with the medical profession'' by pulling an important advance off the market. ''This is a tragic decision,'' added Allan G. Rosenfield, dean of the  School of Public Health, who said the world had eagerly awaited a pill that would avoid unnecessary deaths, and ''now it has been driven from the market by what amounts to a business decision.'' After his meeting with ,  had flown to Rio to head a panel discussion on RU 486. Mobbed by newspaper reporters and television cameras, he called a news conference for later that day, where he spoke perhaps more freely than  had wished: He condemned  for surrendering to intolerance and called its decision ''morally scandalous.'' As doctors, scientists, feminists and family-planning groups protested 's move, many began to ask how this important breakthrough could be brought to market. One suggestion was to set up a new company, perhaps a nonprofit one, to buy the patent - such a company would not have to worry that a boycott would hurt other product lines. Another proposal was that China - the only country other than  to have approved distribution of RU 486 - buy the patent and then manufacture the pill for the whole world. A third called for the World Health Organization, which had sponsored many tests of RU 486's safety and effectiveness, to distribute the pill if the company declined to do so. But the W.H.O. would face problems manufacturing and marketing RU 486, ''because we are not a pharmaceutical company,'' said Dr. Jose Barzelatto, director of human reproduction research.  itself was reluctant to relinquish its patent because RU 486 was so promising in other areas, including fighting breast cancer and dilating the cervix, thus helping reduce the need for Caesarian births in the case of difficult or prolonged labor. There was also the possibility that  might change its mind. Indeed, Pierre Joly, 's vice chairman, hinted at this the day after the pill was suspended. In a radio interview, he said: ''We might resume distribution of RU 486 if the atmosphere becomes peaceful again.'' But the pill's supporters were not optimistic. Then, just two days after the pill was taken off the market, Health Minister Claude Evin summoned Joly to his office to say the Government would not stand for the suspension.  was on a routine business trip that day. Evin was angry that the company had pulled RU 486 off the market just four weeks after he had defied anti-abortion protestors and 's powerful bishops in order to approve 's application to market RU 486. He also feared that if the anti-abortion movement came away triumphant from its crusade against , it would be emboldened to begin battling for the repeal of 's 1975 law legalizing abortion. The Government was not spoiling for such a fight. In an interview, Evin said, ''I was doing what I could to make sure  did not surrender to pressure groups animated by archaic ideologies.'' Evin told Joly that if the company did not reverse its decision, the Government -which owned a 36.25 percent stake in  - would transfer the patent for RU 486 to another company. French patent law empowers the Government to make such transfers for the public good. ''I could not permit the abortion debate to deprive women of a product that represents medical progress,'' he said. ''From the moment Government approval for the drug was granted, RU 486 became the moral property of women, not just the property of the drug company.'' The Government's order delighted . It was the trump card that defeated his opponents and took the onus off his company.  officials had dropped RU 486 in part because they believed its future had become a public matter, too large for a private company to decide. Now the Government had decided the question for them. (Some opponents suggested that Evin and  had orchestrated this startling series of events beforehand. They deny this.) The Government's order ''helped us,'' said . ''It showed the Government was on our side.'' And Joly added, ''We are relieved of the moral burden weighing on our group. For us, the problem is now solved.'' As a result of Evin's order,  is distributing RU 486 to 350 hospital clinics in . Since it was first introduced, more than 12,000 women have taken it worldwide. But, eager not to upset Hoechst,  is not seeking to distribute its revolutionary pill outside of . ''We're not eager to start a new debate,'' Dr.  admitted.  is holding discussions with nonprofit organizations in the United States, Britain and Sweden, which would like to buy the pill at minimum cost from the company and distribute it in their home countries.

"NYT",2008,"France","A Woman Wronged In Old Tale By Weill","Given the popularity of the composer Kurt Weill, it is hard to believe that one of his musical theater works had never been staged in America. ''Marie Galante,'' composed in French, is best known for several songs from the score that long ago entered the Weill canon, especially ''J'Attends un Navire'' (''I'm Waiting for a Ship''). Yet since its 1934 premiere in Paris, the show had received only two other staged productions, the most recent in Rome last year. On Thursday night the enterprising Opera Francais de New York, in partnership with the French Institute Alliance Francaise, presented an elaborate and overdue production, its American premiere, at Gould Hall. Directed by Jean-Philippe Clarac and Olivier Deloeuil, it stars the noted soprano Isabel Bayrakdarian in the title role. While it was gratifying to hear the Weill songs in full dramatic context, the reasons for the neglect of the work came through. ''Marie Galante'' is essentially a play with intermittent songs and incidental music. And that play, by Jacques Deval, is slow-going and grimly melodramatic. Weill, a German Jew, fled Germany with his wife, Lotte Lenya, and settled in Paris in 1933. By 1934, struggling to find work, he jumped at the chance to provide songs for a staged adaptation of Deval's popular novel. The songs, with lyrics mostly by Deval, are performed here in French with English supertitles, and the dialogue spoken in English, which seems an apt choice. The play opens on the waterfront in Bordeaux at night, where sailors, waiting for their ship to leave for Venezuela, are carousing on the docks and searching for women. Marie, who was an orphan on public welfare, is now a free-spirited but desperate young woman, forced to ''go with men,'' as she puts it, to survive. Her character is strongly etched by Deval, and was poignantly portrayed by Ms. Bayrakdarian. The curiously content Marie does not think of herself as a prostitute. She ''likes people,'' as she says to the boorish ship's captain who picks her up. She goes along only when she needs a meal or some money. The captain steals her away on the ship. Two months later, realizing that he cannot bring Marie to Venezuela, he deposits her in Panama during a stopover, assuring her that a liner bound for Bordeaux will return her to France. The passage costs $100, as Marie finds out. She is forced into a life of prostitution. Ms. Bayrakdarian brings a combination of earthy vocal power and subtle expressive shadings to songs like ''J'Attends un Navire'' and ''Youkali,'' a bitter ode to the guiding star that has deserted her. ''Youkali'' was a dance number in the original play, performed here in a vocal version with added lyrics that became popular. But even in this production, with the Deval text abridged, and two Weill songs inserted, ''Marie Galante'' bogs down in stagy melodrama. The Panama depicted here is a haven for fugitives and espionage agents. It is hard to be sympathetic to some of the supporting characters who have drawn-out scenes, like the lowlife tavern operator Staub, played by Michael Zegarski. Staub rents a room from a widow with two adolescent daughters, impregnates one girl while lusting for the other, and turns into a debt-ridden and half-crazed mess. Who cares? Jun Kim is coolly nefarious as the Japanese spy who entices Marie into a fatal mission. The mezzo-soprano Ariana Chris is affecting as Marie's devoted friend Poldine, who sings one of the inserted songs, the impassioned ''Je ne t'aime pas,'' (''I Don't Love You''), in which she tries to stop Marie from participating in the spy's plan. The conductor Yves Abel drew stylish performances from the orchestra of 14 excellent players, including the nimble accordionist William Schimmel. There are, at least, engaging ballads and cabaret songs, some fetching dance music and even a gospel chorus to savor. And Ms. Bayrakdarian gives her all to this intensely dramatic portrayal.

"NYT",1998,"Afghanistan","Afghan Women Demanding End To Their Repression by Militants","""The Government can cover our faces,"" said the intense young woman, who had once been a teacher. ""But underneath, we still want our rights."" The woman was sent home from her job by the militant Islamic Taliban movement after it took control of much of this country in 1996 and decreed that women could no longer work and must be veiled in the all-enveloping chador. She was one of about a dozen women who gathered at some risk in a private home near Kabul this week to meet Carol Bellamy, the executive director of Unicef. Ms. Bellamy had just met several Taliban leaders to press for expanded women's rights, and she wanted to know what the women of Afghanistan wanted. ""We want peace, and work, and the doors of schools to open for our girls,"" someone said. The circle of teachers, a doctor and several homemakers -- sitting crosslegged on the carpeted floor of a mud-walled house -- wanted to tell Ms. Bellamy, woman to woman and without inhibitions, what life was like in Afghanistan after decades of political upheaval, a Soviet invasion, a holy war, a civil war and now an era marked by enforcers of Islamic militancy riding around in jeeps and pickups beating up sinners. In the midst of the session, when a man tried to deliver a message to Ms. Bellamy through an intermediary, she said firmly: ""No men here! This is a meeting for women."" Faces around the room broke into smiles. ""We are women, and you are also, and you can help us,"" another former teacher said. ""Men don't listen to us."" But some men do seem to be listening. In the frank discussions Ms. Bellamy had with women in three provinces this week and through interviews conducted by female reporters who accompanied her, a strong theme emerged. And it was echoed later in conversations with men who, in a twist of unintended justice, could not under their own rules crash a gathering of women who were not their wives or relatives. It was that ""the Talibs,"" as they are known, are destroying an already wounded country, economically and socially. The repression of women, many of whom live like prisoners in their own homes, is only a harsh symptom of a larger disease, they said. It is a fear expressed in different ways by men and women, many of them fresh from years in refugee camps where they lived in some semblance of order, with schools and clinics to serve their needs. Women who say they came home to cast their lot with the Taliban as the best bet for the future feel that they are on the front lines of a battle for survival. ""With half the people of Afghanistan in purdah,"" a midwife said after a session with Ms. Bellamy at a hospital here in Jalalabad, ""we can't find nurses and other hospital staff. We are headed for disaster."" Purdah is the custom of secluding women, shielding them from any men who are not members of their family. Several women said they had asked their husbands to talk to the Taliban about their families' hardships and the broader toll that the movement's hastily issued edicts is taking on Afghanistan. The Taliban brushed aside their fears, they said. Moreover, on the streets, men who call themselves ""good Muslims"" also live in terror of seemingly unprovoked attacks by Islamic enforcers and are easily silenced. This week, a car carrying three foreign women to a meeting in Kabul was rammed deliberately by a Taliban truck flying the white flag of purity. In Jalalabad, Government officials tried to prohibit female journalists from walking in the public bazaar. They said that a Filipino woman had been beaten up last year, and that they did not want another such incident. They appeared unable to guarantee safety from the mobile punishment squads or mysterious kidnappers not linked to the Taliban who recently began to strike in the area. Officials Plead Need for More Time Interviews with Taliban officials indicate that they are either unconcerned or not fully aware of the erosion of the authority that they were at first willingly granted by a conservative Muslim population tired of civil war. Told that almost every woman questioned by reporters ranked universal education as the country's most pressing need, officials said again and again that they recognized that girls had the right to go to school and that they had the duty to provide equal educational opportunities, but that they were incapable of meeting the demand. They cited a lack of teaching materials, and also said there were not enough buildings to create separate schools for girls. ""We need more time,"" a regional governor said. A high-ranking official in Kabul said it was unfair to hold the Taliban responsible for the country's problems. ""The Russians should be blamed,"" he said, repeating a familiar explanation. Afghan men and women do not often disagree with the opinion that pro-Soviet Afghan governments had used education for indoctrination, or that a new curriculum will have to be created. But they see no progress toward that goal. The doubts about where the Taliban, or elements of the movement, may be taking Afghanistan are also provoking open defiance of conscription in some areas, where parents hide their boys from forced recruitment. A war in the north with remnants of the alliance that ruled the country from 1992 to 1996 drains precious resources, human and material. Asked what they wanted most from the Government, a substantial number of women interviewed said peace. But they also listed high among their priorities clean drinking water, better neighborhood sanitation and health centers. One added a plea for the elimination of the stagnant ponds that breed mosquitoes and of the rabid dogs that threaten children. All, in effect, wanted a government that works -- and lets them work. Many families in this country of 21 million people have lost the income not only of women but also of men who died in fighting, were thrown out of jobs in purges of government offices or left in the flight of private businessmen and middle-class professionals. Boys as well as girls are being denied education because many teachers were women who have not been replaced, and their male counterparts who remained in the schools are often not paid and therefore do not show up. ""I go to school, but the teacher doesn't come,"" said a 12-year-old boy who, like others who spoke willingly to a reporter, would be better left unidentified. Asked if his 8-year-old sister should be in school too, he answered quickly, ""Why not?"" When girls at one of dozens of ""home schools"" springing up around the country with the help of foreign foundations or aid programs were asked if their fathers approved of their attending these classes, they shouted, ""Yes! Yes!"" Their teacher came back to her mud-brick village among the green fields of rural Laghman Province after working in a refugee camp in Pakistan. She said she and three other former teachers set up her school in a family home because they could no longer work and girls could no longer go to government schools. The school, one of several hundred supported by a Swedish nonprofit organization, teaches basic literacy and the Koran, which Muslim women in many countries have begun to study to defend themselves from what they see as the misinterpretations of self-styled fundamentalists. ""Maybe in the future they will have a chance to work outside,"" she said of the two dozen little girls seated in rows on the earthen floor. ""But whatever happens, an education will make them better people in their families."" Men as well as women see their children in danger of growing up without a future. Everyone wants to know where the next generation of doctors, lawyers and other professionals will be found. They also see exploitive child labor increasing since the pool of available children is growing. Some children beg in the streets; so do some mothers, especially war widows. ""We realize that if we lose a generation of students, the people will suffer,"" said Saddar Razam, the Acting Governor of Nangarhar Province, of which Jalalabad is the capital. ""We have plans for the education of girls. But we will need help."" Lawlessness Fades But Prices Go Up Taliban leaders seem aware that this is a hot issue internationally, and appear to be using it as a bargaining chip for more international aid. In her meetings with Taliban leaders, Ms. Bellamy, who has suspended all Unicef education projects, told the officials that the United Nations wanted to see action before any more money was spent. The world the Taliban movement imposed on the women of Afghanistan is not without its paradoxes. Everywhere women say they are safer. The era of the mujahedeen, the fractious gangs of holy warriors who drove the Soviet Army from the country in 1992 but then proved incapable of governing it, was marked by lawlessness that fell hard on women. Rape was common. There was often shooting in the streets by day and armed robbery at night. Checkpoints set up by rival movements, often little more than gangs, fleeced people coming and going from one part of Kabul to another or on country roads. All of this, Afghans and foreign aid workers say, is gone in areas controlled by the Taliban, now amounting to two-thirds of the country. ""But we have exchanged the rockets that fell on our houses from the sky for the rockets that hit our stomachs every time the prices go up,"" an Afghan businessman said. In recent months there has been some relaxation in rules governing the behavior of women, though no one seems to know for certain if this reflects official thinking or merely dwindling zeal. In one Kabul neighborhood, people said the requirement to cover the windows of homes where women lived was no longer strictly enforced. Despite the prohibition against noisy shoes, women wear heels that click along the floors. And there are many women who do not wear the all-enveloping chador or burqa, which leaves only a small patch of embroidered grillwork at eye level for navigating the outside world. Instead, they cloak their heads and upper bodies with large shawls that leave their faces free and sometimes allow locks of luxuriant, wavy black hair to escape. This, they say, is more traditionally Afghan. ""The burqa comes from a foreign culture,"" said Sadikka Sadique, an engineer who works in a hospital making orthopedic devices for land-mine victims. Women can no longer work in engineering but can hold jobs in the health services. Encountered in the hospital parking lot, she was elegantly dressed in the baggy trousers and long shirt common across West Asia and South Asia, topped with a navy blue blazer and a finely woven gray shawl. ""I am not afraid of being beaten,"" she said. ""I keep in touch with the Taliban leaders. We are here to push them to open schools and take other steps. It is my wish to see Afghanistan normal."" She said that if outsiders stopped arming the Taliban's foes, the country would be in much better shape for development. She argued that Western countries were silent when the former Government of the mujahedeen, which they supported, also denied women rights. Few girls went to schools then, and female literacy never reached 10 percent. The difference now is that the bar to girls' education is official, and this has attracted worldwide attention. She Is Asked Back To Run a Hospital In some families there are small victories. Sohaila Sadique, Saddika's sister, was recently asked by the Taliban to come back to Kabul and take over the running of a large military-civilian hospital, a job from which she was dismissed more than a year ago. ""They needed a woman,"" Saddika said, just a touch triumphantly, adding after a moment or two, ""Inshallah, the future of women will be more happy here."" Three burqa-clad figures floated closer to her as she spoke and began to giggle with delight at her forthrightness. In the hospital, a young doctor, reflecting on why she came to work for the equivalent of $4 a month when many other professionals were emigrating, said, ""My country is the best place in the world."" ""I don't want to leave it,"" she said. ""I just want to be free to serve it better."" Map showing the location of Jalalabad, Afghanistan: Officials tried to bar newswomen from the bazaar in Jalalabad. (pg. A8)","""The Government can cover our faces,"" said the intense young woman, who had once been a teacher. ""But underneath, we still want our rights."" The woman was sent home from her job by the militant Islamic  movement after it took control of much of this country in 1996 and decreed that women could no longer work and must be veiled in the all-enveloping chador. She was one of about a dozen women who gathered at some risk in a private home near  this week to meet Carol , the executive director of . Ms.  had just met several  leaders to press for expanded women's rights, and she wanted to know what the women of  wanted. ""We want peace, and work, and the doors of schools to open for our girls,"" someone said. The circle of teachers, a doctor and several homemakers -- sitting crosslegged on the carpeted floor of a mud-walled house -- wanted to tell Ms. , woman to woman and without inhibitions, what life was like in  after decades of political upheaval, a  invasion, a holy war, a civil war and now an era marked by enforcers of Islamic militancy riding around in jeeps and pickups beating up sinners. In the midst of the session, when a man tried to deliver a message to Ms.  through an intermediary, she said firmly: ""No men here! This is a meeting for women."" Faces around the room broke into smiles. ""We are women, and you are also, and you can help us,"" another former teacher said. ""Men don't listen to us."" But some men do seem to be listening. In the frank discussions Ms.  had with women in three provinces this week and through interviews conducted by female reporters who accompanied her, a strong theme emerged. And it was echoed later in conversations with men who, in a twist of unintended justice, could not under their own rules crash a gathering of women who were not their wives or relatives. It was that ""the Talibs,"" as they are known, are destroying an already wounded country, economically and socially. The repression of women, many of whom live like prisoners in their own homes, is only a harsh symptom of a larger disease, they said. It is a fear expressed in different ways by men and women, many of them fresh from years in refugee camps where they lived in some semblance of order, with schools and clinics to serve their needs. Women who say they came home to cast their lot with the  as the best bet for the future feel that they are on the front lines of a battle for survival. ""With half the people of  in purdah,"" a midwife said after a session with Ms.  at a hospital here in , ""we can't find nurses and other hospital staff. We are headed for disaster."" Purdah is the custom of secluding women, shielding them from any men who are not members of their family. Several women said they had asked their husbands to talk to the  about their families' hardships and the broader toll that the movement's hastily issued edicts is taking on . The  brushed aside their fears, they said. Moreover, on the streets, men who call themselves ""good Muslims"" also live in terror of seemingly unprovoked attacks by Islamic enforcers and are easily silenced. This week, a car carrying three foreign women to a meeting in  was rammed deliberately by a  truck flying the white flag of purity. In , Government officials tried to prohibit female journalists from walking in the public bazaar. They said that a Filipino woman had been beaten up last year, and that they did not want another such incident. They appeared unable to guarantee safety from the mobile punishment squads or mysterious kidnappers not linked to the  who recently began to strike in the area.

"NYT",2010,"Afghanistan","Afghan Women Fear the Loss of Modest Gains","MAHMUD-E RAQI, Afghanistan -- Women's precarious rights in Afghanistan have begun seeping away. Girls' schools are closing; working women are threatened; advocates are attacked; and terrified families are increasingly confining their daughters to home. For women, instability, as much as the Taliban themselves, is the enemy. Women are casualties of the fighting, not only in the already conservative and embattled Pashtun south and east, but also in districts in the north and center of the country where other armed groups have sprung up. As Afghan and Western governments explore reconciliation with the Taliban, women fear that the peace they long for may come at the price of rights that have improved since the Taliban government was overthrown in 2001. ''Women do not want war, but none of them want the Taliban of 1996 again; no one wants to be imprisoned in the yards of their houses,'' said Rahima Zarifi, the Women's Ministry representative from the northern Baghlan Province. Interviews around the country with at least two dozen female members of Parliament, government officials, activists, teachers and young girls suggest a nuanced reality -- fighting constricts women's freedoms nearly as much as a Taliban government, and conservative traditions already limit women's rights in many places. Women, however, express a range of fears about a Taliban return, from political to domestic -- that they will be shut out of negotiations about any deals with the insurgents and that the Taliban's return would drive up bride prices, making it more profitable for a family to force girls into marriage earlier. For many women, the prospect of a resurgence of the Taliban or other conservative groups is stark. ''It will ruin our life,'' said Shougoufa, 40, as she sorted through sequins and gold sparkles at the bazaar in the city of Pul-i-Khumri in Afghanistan's north. ''I am a tailor and I need to come to the bazaar to buy these things,'' she said. ''But if the Taliban come, I will not be able to come. Already we are hearing some girls cannot go to their work anymore.'' In teachers' tea-break rooms, beauty shop training sessions, bazaars and the privacy of their homes, young women worry that their parents will marry them off early, so they will not be forced to marry Taliban. In the Pashtun-dominated district of Taghob, east of Kabul, girls' schools have been closed and any teaching is done at home, the provincial education director said. That does not trouble some local officials. ''Look, our main priority is to feed our people, to provide rest and to protect their lives,'' said Haji Farid, a local member of Parliament. ''Why are people focusing on education and sending girls to school? Boys walk three, four, five kilometers to their school. How can a girl walk two, three, four kilometers? During a war you cannot send a girl beyond her door. No one can guarantee her honor. So it is hard to send your daughter to school.'' In Kandahar, Helmand and Zabul, all unstable southern provinces, there are girls' schools open in the provincial capitals, but in outlying districts there are few, if any. In Zabul Province, there are just six schools for girls, four in the capital and two outside, but few families send their girls to school because of the fighting, said Muhammad Alam, the acting head of the provincial education department. In Baghlan Province, in northern Afghanistan, the situation for women has steadily worsened over the past year. Ms. Zarifi, the Women's Ministry representative, has endured assassination attempts and demonstrations against her work. Three months ago, a female member of the provincial council was paralyzed in an attack, and a woman was stabbed to death in the daytime in the middle of the provincial capital earlier in July. By contrast, most of Kapisa Province, which lies northeast of Kabul, is peaceful. There is a mediation program in the capital to help women and girls when they face domestic violence. In the predominantly ethnically Tajik north there are large, lively schools for girls, where families even allow those who are married to complete high school. Women's advocates are concerned that they are increasingly being shut out of political decisions. At an international conference in Kabul on July 20, which was meant to showcase the country's plans for the future, President Hamid Karzai said nothing about how women's rights might be protected in negotiations. The very first meeting on negotiations, held by Mr. Karzai on July 22 with former leaders who had fought the Taliban, did not include a single woman, despite government pledges. When asked, government officials said that women would be included in later sessions. Although Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton has also pledged that she will not desert Afghan women and that any deal with the Taliban that traded peace for women's rights was ''a red line,'' women remain wary. ''Right now it's a big challenge for women to go to school and work, but at least according to our Constitution and laws they have the right to do so,'' said Nargis Nehan, 31, an Afghan women's advocate. ''If the Taliban come back, by law women will be restricted and not allowed to leave their homes,'' she said, adding, ''Maybe not everywhere, but in those districts where they are in power.'' There is also the real possibility that a deal with the Taliban could stoke the anger of non-Pashtuns who once fought and still fear them, raising the prospect of renewed fighting. Afghanistan's women have long led exceptionally constrained lives. The combination of a male-dominated tribal culture in which women have been often treated as little more than chattel, combined with a conservative practice of Islam and a nationwide lack of education, meant that long before the Taliban arrived in the mid-1990s, women had few opportunities beyond the home. The mujahedeen leaders who forced out the Soviets in the late 1980s were as conservative as the Taliban in many places, keeping women at home in order to preserve family honor instead of educating them or integrating them into the government. ''Families want to send their daughters to school, but it is hard for them to decide to do so because of the fighting and insecurity,'' said Mr. Alam, the head of provincial education in Zabul Province. The families of women who work in offices are threatened, said Rahima Jana, who heads the province's Department of Women's Affairs. And the group Human Rights Watchdocumented instances of night letters meant to scare women into staying at home. ''Security is a big challenge, and we cannot work when there is bad security,'' Ms. Jana said. ''Last year was much better than this year.'' In Mahmud-e Raqi, 12 teenage girls sat around a small trunk filled with beauticians' tools -- combs, boxes of hair dye, scissors, nail polish, hair spray -- and watched closely as the instructor sat one of the girls in a desk chair and demonstrated how to cut off split ends evenly. In most places in the world this scene would hardly be a sign of women's liberation, but in this corner of Afghanistan, it meant a great deal. The girls, ages 15 to 17, had been allowed to come from their villages to the provincial capital; they will take home a trunk of beauty goods and can earn their own money in their homes by offering beauty services to women in their village. This chance at determining a little of their future is what they fear will be threatened if the Taliban return through a negotiated peace settlement. ''They will beat us and forbid us from this freedom, the freedom to come here, to this class; they will stop us from doing things,'' said Biboli, 16, a girl with long brown hair barely covered by a thin white veil. The greatest fear is that no one is really listening, said Habiba Shamim, one of the instructors. ''Please,'' she pleaded. ''Carry our words to people.''","MAHMUD-E RAQI,  -- Women's precarious rights in  have begun seeping away.

"NYT",2009,"Afghanistan","Afghan Women March, America Turns Away","Nader Nadery is a member of the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission. Haseeb Humayoon, a student at Middlebury College, has worked as a consultant to nongovernmental groups in Afghanistan.  LAST November, extremists on motorbikes opposed to education for women sprayed acid on a group of students from the Mirwais School for Girls in Kandahar, Afghanistan. Several young women were severely burned. Yet it did not take more than a few weeks for even the most cruelly disfigured girls to return to school. Like the crowds of women in Kabul this week who protested a new law that restricts their rights, the Mirwais students demonstrate unbending courage and resolve for progress. They don't fear much -- except that the world might abandon them. That is why President Obama's Afghanistan-Pakistan policy speech last month and his administration's related white paper are worrisome: both avoided any reference to democracy in Afghanistan, while pointedly pushing democratic reforms in Pakistan. The new policy represents critical shifts -- such as a new emphasis on civilian work, and recognizing the regional nature of the problem and the inadequacy and abuse of resources. But a faltering commitment to the democratization of Afghanistan and ambiguous statements from Washington on an exit strategy have left us Afghans scratching our heads. The Obama administration's bold declaration of what is to be defeated (Al Qaeda) and absence of equal zest for what is to be built (democracy) inspires a sense of deja vu. The last time the United States was seriously involved in Afghanistan, its goal was the defeat of the Soviet Union. But after that ''success,'' extremist militias greedy for power brought our society to its knees. In the absence of the rule of law and legitimate and democratic institutions, the militias' atrocities allowed the Taliban to rise to power and harbor those behind the 9/11 attacks. To defeat the forces of oppression, Washington must promote and protect the ideals of democracy and human rights. It is true that Afghanistan has miles to go before it will be a real democracy. But why won't the new administration state a commitment to helping us get there? First, with the economic crisis and other domestic priorities, there is a sense in Washington that helping Afghanistan democratize is either a luxury American taxpayers cannot afford or a charitable cause they can delay. This shows a misunderstanding of both what is needed to help Afghans build a real democracy and the lasting interest of the United States. Second, there is a temptation among some in Washington to believe that if the zeal for democratic reform or women's and minority rights in Afghanistan were relaxed, Taliban insurgents would find ''reconciliation'' more attractive and the war would end more quickly. This belief is encouraged by the radically conservative forces that have increased their influence since 2005 over the Kabul government, which has been backtracking on its commitment to rights like freedom of the press and equality under the law. This was exemplified by two events last month: the upholding  of a 20-year jail sentence given to a young journalist for printing a controversial article from the Internet that was critical of the role traditionally assigned to women in Islam; and President Hamid Karzai's signing of a law affecting the country's Shiite minority that places restrictions on when a woman can leave her house and states the circumstances in which she is obliged to have sex with her husband. That law prompted the protests this week in Kabul. It would seem that the escalating violence the country has suffered since 2005 would be a pretty convincing demonstration that giving up ground on democracy and human rights is not helping end this war. Rather, the Taliban has interpreted it as a sign of the weakness of the Afghan government and its international allies. The Afghan public, even as it faces an unpopular and brutal insurgency, is no longer sure if a government that is reluctant to stand up for human rights deserves support. Afghans are also aware that if their government does not honestly commit to judicial and legislative reforms, it will lose American and European public support. Third, and perhaps most important, many Westerners still cling to incorrect assumptions about Afghans, which they use as excuses for abandoning democratization. One such belief is that Afghans are a ''tribal people'' who probably do not want a say in choosing their leaders. Others claim that because Afghanistan is a traditional Islamic society, any promotion of democracy and women's rights will be resented as an imposition of Western values. Another much-heard statement is that Afghans are ''fierce independent fighters'' who mercilessly defy external influence, so the United States better not get bogged down in this ''graveyard of empires.'' These assumptions are wrong. In our first democratic elections, in October 2004, 11 million Afghans -- 41 percent of them women -- registered to vote. In a 2008 survey by the Asia Foundation, 76 percent of Afghans responded that democracy was the best form of government. An estimated 10 million people, one-third of the population, live in cities. Almost 65 percent of Afghans are under the age of 25. This dominant generation came of age not under the old tribal structures but in an Afghanistan whose traditional fabrics were torn apart by Soviet tanks and our long civil war. As for women's rights, the troubles that brewed in Afghanistan during the 1990s -- civil war, followed by the Taliban's totalitarianism and harboring of Al Qaeda -- were in great part the result of the female half of our population being deprived of social and political participation. Like everyone else, Afghans crave security, justice, accountability, educational and employment opportunities, and a promise of a future. Democracy and progress are not products to be packaged and exported to Afghanistan. Afghans have to fight for them.

"NYT",2014,"Afghanistan","Afghan Women Seeing Hope in the Ballot Box","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Mariam Wardak is one of those young Afghans with her feet in two worlds: At 28, she has spent much of her adult life in Afghanistan, but she grew up in the United States after her family fled there. She vividly remembers the culture shock of visits back to her family's village in rural Wardak Province a decade ago. ''A woman wouldn't even show her face to her brother-in-law living in the same house for 25 years,'' she said. ''People would joke that if someone kidnapped our ladies, we would have to find them from their voices. Now women in Wardak show their faces -- they see everybody else's faces.'' Ms. Wardak's mother, Zakia, is a prime example. She used to wear a burqa in public, but now has had her face printed on thousands of ballot pamphlets for the provincial council in Wardak. She campaigns in person in a district, Saydabad, that is thick with Taliban. She has plenty of company in this year's elections, scheduled for Saturday. Another 300 women are running for provincial council seats around the country, more than ever before. And for the first time, a woman -- Habiba Sarobi, the former governor of Bamian Province -- is running for vice president on a leading national ticket. There is finally the sense here, after years of international aid and effort geared toward improving Afghan's women's lives, that women have become a significant part of Afghan political life, if not a powerful one. But their celebratory moment is also colored by the worry that those gains could so easily be reversed if extremists come back into power, or if Western aid dwindles. Those concerns have added urgency to this campaign season for women who are fighting to make their leadership more acceptable in a still deeply repressive society. ''It's an exciting and terrifying point, because the international presence has actually empowered the women here, and when they leave, some of those women will be concerned,'' said Mariam Wardak, who is working on Ms. Sarobi's campaign as well as her mother's. One notable change is simply that there have been more women speaking from the dais during rallies, including the wives of two of the more prominent national candidates. That is a novelty that has drawn crowds in a country where most male public figures keep their wives in traditional seclusion -- including President Hamid Karzai, despite his promises to women's groups years ago that she would be a visible part of Afghan life. Afghans have been particularly intrigued by Ms. Sarobi's emergence as a running mate for the presidential candidate Zalmay Rassoul. She is not just a token name on a presidential ticket, but a campaign draw in her own right, as her stirring speeches have added a much-needed shot of crowd appeal to Mr. Rassoul's otherwise staid and low-energy campaign. Last Thursday, thousands of men and a few hundred women in the northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif cheered wildly for Ms. Sarobi, after only polite applause for the presidential candidate. ''She pretty much rocked the show,'' said Haseeb Hamayoon, a Rassoul campaign aide. Ms. Sarobi explained, ''People want some change, and a woman on the ticket is a change for them.'' Fawzia Koofi, a politician and rights advocate, at one point said she would be running as a presidential candidate in this election, but she missed by a year the minimum age of 40 when candidates were registered. She recalled the days when politically active Afghan women were relegated to chanting slogans from behind privacy screens. ''A woman for vice president? Eleven years ago, even dreaming about this was impossible,'' Ms. Koofi said. On the campaign trail, all of the eight presidential candidates still in the race have at least paid some lip service to supporting causes important to women -- even Abdul Rab Rassoul Sayyaf, an extremely traditionalist Pashtun candidate and warlord who as a member of Parliament was a bitter opponent of a law intended to criminalize violence against women. For his part, Mr. Sayyaf said he would ''reconsider his past actions in view of respect for women's rights.'' Most of the candidates have appeared at women's groups to answer questions, and participated in debates on women's issues. ''This time from the beginning all of them have been talking about women's rights,'' said Hasina Safi, head of the Afghanistan Women's Network, a coalition of women's groups. ''They have really figured out that women count.'' Partly that is because women have become particularly well-organized in recent years, nurtured by generous international funding for their organizations and causes, and requirements by donors that projects should be gender sensitive, with such measures as equal opportunity units, gender equality training and guaranteed employment of a percentage of women. That has helped improve their political clout, despite disappointing results in voter registration drives. The actual percentage of women registered to vote has not changed appreciably, about 35 percent of the total, since previous elections. But tougher controls on voting will make illegal proxy voting -- where men especially in conservative areas cast the votes allotted to the adult women in their households -- harder to get away with. And with years of set-asides for women running for Parliament and provincial council seats, women have become accustomed to some share of the power. Provincial councils are also being contested in the vote on Saturday, with 20 percent of the seats set aside for women. About 300 women are running for such seats nationwide, which the Independent Election Commission says is the highest number ever. Even in conservative Kandahar Province, a tenth of the candidates are women. ''Today, you can now say that a woman's vote is going for a woman,'' Ms. Sarobi told a crowd of more than 1,000 women in Kabul on Monday. Many women are quick to caution that they still have a long way to go. ''Where are their first ladies?'' said Zahra Mosawi, a rights advocate. ''We have only seen one of the presidential candidates' wives so far.'' She was talking about Ashraf Ghani, one of the front-runners, who had his wife, Rula, join him to make a campaign speech, another Afghan campaign first. His running mate, the Uzbek warlord Abdul Rashid Dostum, also brought his wife, Zabaida, along to talk to a group of women at one campaign meeting. One disappointment among women's advocates has been Mr. Karzai's refusal to allow his wife, Zeenat, to make public appearances. Although she is one of Afghanistan's most famous women, so few Afghans have ever seen their country's first lady that it is said she can go shopping without bodyguards. Before her husband became president, Mrs. Karzai was a practicing gynecologist, and activists felt she would make a powerful role model for a generation of girls who were finally allowed full schooling in Afghanistan. Instead, she has remained in seclusion over the past decade, and some feel that has reinforced the traditional view of Afghan women as subservient, forbidden to go out without their husbands' permission. When Mrs. Karzai registered to vote for the first time, in 2004, it was done in private. ''He promised so many times to bring his wife out and he never did,'' said Mariam Nabizada, a Kabul political activist for Mr. Rassoul's campaign and for Ms. Sarobi. Now that issue no longer looms so large, she said: ''With a female running mate, it has encouraged more women than ever to participate.'' Still, Afghan women are suspicious about what is to come after Western officials turn away from Afghanistan, and about what agenda the country's political power players are truly pursuing. Particularly worrisome, to Ms. Mosawi and other women, has been the refrain from many of the presidential candidates of the need to make peace with the Taliban, whose government famously confined women to their homes and banned them from most work. ''They're all talking about peace with the Taliban, which is a big danger for us,'' she said. ''We're not hearing assurances about preserving all the achievements of women in these years.'' Many women are quick to note that little has changed outside of the cities; in rural Afghanistan, where most women live, women are still little more than the property of their brothers, fathers and husbands. A victory for Ms. Sarobi and other candidates would certainly help, Ms. Wardak said, ''If women do as well as they hope in this election, it will be a huge self-esteem boost.''",",  -- Mariam  is one of those young s with her feet in two worlds: At 28, she has spent much of her adult life in , but she grew up in the  after her family fled there.

"WP",2004,"Afghanistan","Afghanistan's Milestone","The constitutional loya jirga that concluded in Kabul Sunday was a milestone on the Afghan people's path to democracy. Afghans have seized the opportunity provided by the United States and its international partners to lay the foundation for democratic institutions and provide a framework for national elections in 2004. The Afghan people manifested this remarkable commitment to democracy in two ways. They defied the enemies of Afghanistan's progress -- remnants of the extremist Taliban and al Qaeda forces -- by participating in elections for the delegates to the constitutional loya jirga. The extremists sought to intimidate candidates and voters. They failed. Women especially were not intimidated. There was a powerful reversal of symbolism when the Kabul soccer stadium -- used less than three years ago by the Taliban to execute women accused of adultery -- was  used by thousands of women to choose their representatives to the constitutional loya jirga. Of the voting delegates, 102 were women -- more than 20 percent of the total delegates. Second, Afghans overcame their past. Instead of relying on the power of the gun, they embraced the often difficult and sometimes messy democratic process of debating, listening and compromising. They trusted in the power of their words by openly deliberating the important issues. Afghans used newspapers, radios, teahouses, schools, universities, mosques -- even the Internet -- as forums to debate fundamental issues such as the system of government, the role of religion, human rights -- particularly the role of women -- and, in a country with more than a dozen ethnic groups, such emotional issues as official languages and the relationship between the center and provinces. Such a wide-ranging debate is unprecedented in more than 5,000 years of Afghan history. The Afghan people's desire to succeed overcame the potential for failure. In the midst of sharp debates, the delegates and people of Afghanistan were unswervingly committed to obtaining a sound constitution. Attempts by warlords and religious fundamentalists to hijack the process were thwarted. Women and minorities held leadership roles. When one brave young woman denounced some of the delegates for their role in the destruction of Afghanistan in the 1990s, the chairman initially sought to throw her out of the hall. The delegates forced him to relent, and Malalai Joya refused to be intimidated and went on to play an active role in her working committee. By the loya jirga's completion, three women were part of the seven-member leadership team and several more took leading positions in the working committees. When ethnic and regional divisions emerged as possible fault lines over issues such as official languages, the delegates decided to find unity in diversity by making all languages official where they are spoken by the majority. This is unprecedented for Afghanistan and the region. With the Afghan people and the world watching, Hazaras, Pashtuns, Tajiks, Turkmen, Uzbeks and others adopted one of the most enlightened constitutions in the Islamic world. The Afghan constitution sets forth a presidential system with a strong parliament and an independent judiciary. The final document embraces a centralized government structure, which reflects most delegates' belief  that years of war and the destruction of national institutions have left the central government far too weak. Delegates strengthened parliament by determining basic state policies and requiring confirmation of key presidential appointees, including the head of the central bank and the director of the national intelligence service. The Afghan constitution also sets forth  parallel commitments to Islam and to human rights. While embracing Islam as the state religion, the document provides broad religious freedom -- allowing adherents of other faiths to practice their religions and observe religious rites. The loya jirga increased the number of women in parliament to an average of two female representatives from each province and explicitly stated, ""Citizens of Afghanistan -- whether men or women -- have equal rights and duties before the law."" Accepting equality between men and women marks a revolutionary change in the roles women are able to play in Afghan government and society. The United Nations has played a vital role in building Afghan political institutions since the Bonn Conference set the country on its current course. In particular the secretary general's special representative, Lakhdar Brahimi, was critical in helping the loya jirga delegates bridge their differences and achieve this successful outcome. Afghanistan faces more challenges: implementing this constitution, defeating the remaining extremists and terrorists, disarming militias, strengthening national institutions, eliminating narcotics production and helping the poorest of Afghans gain a foothold on the ladder of opportunity. After the suffering of the past 20 years, ordinary people of Afghanistan want their country to work. By adopting a sound constitution through an orderly and transparent process, Afghans have cleared a major hurdle. Afghanistan has sent a compelling message to the rest of the world that by investing in that country's development, the United States is investing in success. Americans can take pride in the role we have played in leading the multilateral effort to support Afghan democratization. The toppling of the Taliban and the stabilizing presence of the  coalition and NATO International Security Assistance Force troops have enabled the seeds of political progress to sprout. President Bush's decision to increase aid to Afghanistan -- which will likely total more than $2 billion in  fiscal 2004 -- will accelerate reconstruction of the country's national army,  police force, economic infrastructure, schools and medical system. Our work in Afghanistan is not yet done. It will take several years and a sustained commitment of significant resources by the United States and the international community before the country can stand on its own feet. Given the stakes involved, we must remain committed for as long as it takes to succeed. The writer is special presidential envoy and ambassador to Afghanistan.","The constitutional loya jirga that concluded in  Sunday was a milestone on the Afghan people's path to democracy.

"NYT",1987,"Afghanistan","AFGHANS MIX 'SOVIETIZATION' AND FREE MARKET","The Soviet-backed Government is seeking support by emphasizing free-market principles, women's rights and the fundamentals of Islam. Despite wide distrust, Government officials and diplomats here say, the Government may have begun cementing Moscow's influence in the country, especially among the educated elite. Tens of thousands of young people have studied in the Soviet Union in recent years and aid from Moscow has gone to build hospitals, schools and even mosques. Western diplomats and some others say that with the Government's fight against American-backed guerrillas at a standoff, despite the presence of about 115,000 Soviet troops, this ''Sovietization'' of Afghanistan could insure the loyalty of the next generation of educated people. 'All Will Be Lost' An Afghan businessman, pointing to his son, said in an interview that he feared there was nothing he could do to prevent the indoctrination of the boy in school. ''If the Russians are still here when he is out of school, all will be lost,'' he said. All generalities about the direction of Afghan society are difficult because most of the country is still under violent dispute. Many experts say Kabul controls the major cities and roadways but only a fraction of the countryside. Others say the Afghan guerrillas also control little of the countryside but are able to move freely and exert influence in most places as long as Soviet and Afghan troops are not there. Many experts therefore assert that the specter of a permanently ''Sovietized'' country is exaggerated and that Afghan resentment of foreign domination, which has been a feature of Afghan history for 2,000 years, cannot help but continue. A Phenomenon of the Cities In any case, such Soviet influence appears to be largely a phenomenon of the cities and their environs, where Government education and literacy programs have been introduced and wages increased over the years. But the style of government has had to accommodate Afghan traditions. For the People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan, which has ruled the country since taking power in a military coup in 1978, the first step in that effort has been to recognize that Marxism is an unlikely transplant in a country that has engaged in free trade since the days of the Silk Route to China. ''In the beginning, everyone wanted to bring everything under state control,'' said Sayed Amanuddin, Afghanistan's Deputy Prime Minister. ''But the revolution is not a socialist revolution or a Communist revolution. It is a national democratic revolution that respects the private sector.'' Mr. Amanuddin said that 80 percent of Afghanistan's $3 billion economy was in private hands. This includes almost all farms, but excludes utilities and some industries. Thus the Government may pledge undying friendship with Moscow, condemn ''reactionary elements'' trying to overthrow it and rely on Soviet aid for 40 percent of its budget, but it has also just sponsored a conference on encouraging private entrepreneurs and continually proclaims its faith in Islam, despite the preachings of some party leaders two decades ago that religion was a drag on progress. Ancient Game Is Revived Other efforts are under way to court support from traditional quarters. In a small example, for the first time in years, there has been a revival of the ancient Afghan game of buzkashi, which is a frenzied contest with dozens of horsemen fighting for possession of a goat carcass. Evening television emphasizes religious programming, including a state-sponsored Koran reading contest. Afghan soldiers can be seen walking the streets carrying Islamic prayer beads. Recognizing also that the insurgents are in many cases Islamic fundamentalists, the Government has begun spending large sums to build and reconstruct mosques and place more mullahs, or religious leaders, on the public payroll. Foreign Minister Abdul Wakil said in a recent speech, for example, that ''thousands of mullahs each will get big amounts of money'' under new Government programs, but that the funds would be given to those clerics ''coming to the side of the truth'' - that is, supporting the Government's battle against the guerrillas. Officials also acknowledge that an attempt to collectivize farms some years ago resulted in violent clashes, infuriating so many powerful religious leaders and landlords that it had to be dropped. Instead, the Government tries to enforce certain limits on the size of landholdings. Many Signs of Capitalism The signs of capitalism abound in this busy capital, but nowhere more than at Shazada Market, the hub of Afghanistan's export and import trade. There businessmen can walk in with a shipping order and obtain a $10,000 loan at 12 percent to import Japanese or European goods to be sold - but mostly smuggled - to Pakistan and elsewhere in South Asia. Mohammed Rahim Arzmand, president of the currency exchange market, said that its 220 storefronts do $2 million in business a day. Their customers are largely the 6,000 people who import European and American clothes, Japanese electronics and other products for re-export. ''Our Government is allowing us to do business here because we are bringing dollars into Afghanistan,'' Mr. Arzmand said, interrupting a flood of telephone calls for an interview. Generally, he said, business has been brisk despite the war through much of the countryside. Afghan imports destined for re-export come in hundreds of 20-foot metal crates each month, some brought from Japan on the Trans-Siberian Railroad. Some goods are shipped in sealed containers to Karachi, Pakistan, then brought overland under an agreement with Pakistan that permits such shipments because Afghanistan has no port. Commerce Is Uninterrupted Many of the goods can be found in Afghan bazaars, from Yugoslav hams to French perfume, American jeans and Japanese calculators. Businessmen say they sell a lot of these items to the estimated 9,000 Soviet civilians stationed in Afghanistan. There is an ingenuity about the business that seems peculiarly Afghan or South Asian. The crates, for instance, all seem to end up as tiny homes or storefronts themselves in the city's poor neighborhoods. War is not permitted to interrupt Afghanistan's commerce. Businessmen noted that traders shipping materials to neighboring Iran or Pakistan simply make payoffs to Afghan authorities, Soviet soldiers, guerrilla leaders or whoever else controls the territory through which they must pass. In interviews, many businessmen complained about inflation - estimated at 20 to 30 percent a year - but said they were managing to live under a ''revolutionary'' Government. But many others said privately that Soviet influence was highly resented and that they wished for the day that the Russian troops would leave. ''The people may tell you something different,'' said an Afghan professional worker living in Kabul, ''but let me tell you that 99.9 percent of the Afghan people want this Government out and they want the Russian troops out.'' The use of religion to build support for the Government is also difficult to assess, although Government officials were able to show foreign journalists many mosques that had been rebuilt under Government programs. ''We are glad the Government is providing us with assistance,'' said Qari Akhtar Mohammed, a mullah at a newly rebuilt mosque in the outskirts of Kabul. ''They are making sure that there are no obstacles to the health of Islam.'' But a worshiper leaving the mosque after evening prayers said he was not so sure the actions were winning support among the people. Asked if the Government was sincere in strengthening Islam, he said: ''I'm not going to answer that question. What do you think?'' Women Make Gains Many diplomats, professionals and others say that the Government has won support among working women because it appears to have gone out of its way to provide day-care services, literacy training and other benefits for women. ''Women are the strongest supporters of the revolution,'' said Soraya, a party member and general secretary of the Afghan Red Crescent Society. ''For the first time, our women have been given equal rights at the level of education, work, salaries and other areas.'' A Western diplomat said that rights for women was one of the few areas he would concede had been an achievement of the 1978 revolution, but he and others noted that one reason women have moved into higher positions in the workplace is that so many men are off fighting the guerrillas. At Kabul University, where today 55 percent of the 7,000 students are women, many women recall that one of the insurgent leaders, Gulbaddin Hekmatyar, is an Islamic fundamentalist who used to oppose women's removal of their veils when he was a student there more than 20 years ago. ''His people used to throw acid at women,'' said Jamila Takhari, a 19-year-old student. ''They don't want women to have an equal role in society.'' She and her friends agreed that if Mr. Hekmatyar were to ever come to power in Afghanistan, women would have to struggle to retain their rights.","The Soviet-backed Government is seeking support by emphasizing free-market principles, women's rights and the fundamentals of Islam.

"NYT",2009,"France","After Suicides, France Wrestles With Worker Stress","Media attention to a recent spate of suicides at France Telecom has revealed a paradox at the heart of French society: even with robust labor protection, workers feel profoundly insecure, with many complaining that the pace of economic change is pushing them beyond their limits. A popular image outside France is of a cosseted work force protected from layoffs by near-hermetic job security and pampered by a 35-hour workweek. But the reality is often different, according to experts, union representatives and the workers themselves. ''When I started as a psychiatrist, 35 years ago, my patients were talking about their personal lives,'' said Marie-France Hirigoyen, a French psychiatrist who did pioneering work on bullying and workplace relations. ''Now it's all about their jobs. People are suffering in the workplace. They shouldn't be, from the logic of management. After all, they have a good job, a nice vacation. But they are suffering.'' In statistical terms, the 24 suicides at France Telecom since February 2008 -- including eight since the beginning of summer, with the latest confirmed on Monday -- are not extraordinary for a company employing 102,0000 people in France. The World Health Organization put the suicide rate in France at 26.4 per 100,000 for men and 9.2 for women in 2005. That is the highest among large European economies, but still well behind Japan. In the United States, the comparable rates are 17.7 for men and 4.5 for women. Mental health experts are always extremely cautious about attributing a suicide to any one cause: one often never knows what forces act upon a person. But what has caught the attention of the public and the French government is that many of the suicides, and more than a dozen failed suicides, have been attributed by some experts and labor officials to work-related problems. Adding to that is what Dr. Hirigoyen described as the spectacular nature of some cases. In one case a man stabbed himself, hara-kiri style, in the middle of a meeting (he survived); in another, a woman killed herself by leaping from a fifth-floor office window. On Monday, a 51-year-old employee threw himself from a highway bridge. ''Stress has become a national sport,'' said Michel Marchet, the secretary of the banking chapter of France's General Confederation of Labor, or C.G.T. union. ''We need employers to modify the way that they organize work, but we don't have the impression that anything will happen soon.'' Despite the 35-hour workweek law, European Union data shows that the French last year worked a 41-hour week on average, putting them 13th of the 27 nations in the bloc. (Austria was ranked No. 1 at 44 hours.) In 2006 and 2007, three technicians working at the automaker Renault's research and development center, near Paris, committed suicide, according to Benoit Coquille, a company spokesman. At the time, union leaders cited pressures on the job. In response, Carlos Ghosn, the Renault chief executive, went to the center to talk with workers and managers. Detailed questionnaires were sent to more than 11,000 employees, and face-to-face meetings were held to discuss work conditions. Mr. Coquille said the company decided to go back and explain again basic management rules throughout the chain of command. It is impossible to say that there have been no additional work-related suicides, Mr. Coquille said, but since then, ''there haven't been any with an obvious connection to the job.'' France Telecom has hired Technologia, the same consulting firm that helped to guide Renault's response, to assess its situation. It is in an unusual position: despite a partial privatization in 1997, two-thirds of the company's work force are still classified as public servants and cannot be fired. Yet, even that level of job security can bring stress. France Telecom is being forced to compete with private companies in a fast-moving global market. From 2006 through 2008, the company cut more than 22,000 jobs through voluntary departures. Nearly half of those were workers who either took early retirement, accepted transfers to civil service positions outside the company or left to start their own businesses with the company's backing. (By comparison, BT Group, the former British telephone monopoly that has been carrying out its own wrenching reorganization, cut 15,000 jobs in 2008 alone and has said it will cut an additional  15,000 this year.) Sebastien Crozier, head of the  Confederation of Professional and Managerial Staff, part of the general union at France Telecom, estimated that in  the last five years, half of all France Telecom employees had either changed jobs internally, changed work locations, or both. That, he said, has created a sense of constant upheaval and insecurity. Further, there is a sense that managers are deliberately trying to get employees to quit, he said. Since giving up civil service status would mean sacrificing retirement benefits, many people simply try to hold out, even if it means they have little of substance to do or they feel they are not being used effectively. In response to a flurry of media attention, France Telecom has said it will freeze worker transfers until the end of October, establish an anonymous help line for troubled employees and add extra psychological and human resources support. ''We are the only incumbent telecoms operator not to have carried out mass redundancies,'' said Olivier Barberot, the head of human resources at France Telecom. ''Most people, the bulk of them, have been able to increase their skills and move on to new jobs,'' he said. ''But some have had difficulty adapting.'' In an interview, Xavier Darcos, France's employment minister, said the problem of workplace stress was not confined to France. But he criticized the company's previous approach, saying future reorganization would be ''better supervised.'' ''Maybe he underestimated the effect of the transformation on staff and the media impact,'' Mr. Darcos said of France Telecom's chief executive, Didier Lombard. ''We are in a transforming economy, and the evaluation tools used are a bit out of date,'' Mr. Darcos said. Nonetheless, he said, a job, even a highly stressful one, is better than unemployment. ''For us, unemployment is the absolute failure,'' Mr. Darcos said. ''We prefer to have people who don't feel totally happy at work, or to work part time, rather than people being unemployed.'' The unemployment rate in France was 9.8 percent in July, up two percentage points from a year earlier. It probably would have been even higher without government programs to subsidize the auto industry and keep workers on the payroll, at least part time. In the end, at France Telecom, though, some things are inevitable. Echoing comments by Mr. Lombard and Mr. Darcos, Mr. Barberot, the company's human resources chief, said,  ''We can't stop the reorganization.''","Media attention to a recent spate of suicides at  has revealed a paradox at the heart of French society: even with robust labor protection, workers feel profoundly insecure, with many complaining that the pace of economic change is pushing them beyond their limits.

"NYT",1982,"France","AMERICAN FALL FASHIONS: THE NEW FUNCTIONALISM","Fashion is in transition. The contest is not between long or short skirts, narrow or full skirts or 1950's hourglass styles versus 1960's rectangular shapes. It is between clothes for leisured, moneyed women who use them as a symbol of their social status and women who think of fashion in a functional way. This does not preclude flattery, femininity and all the other attributes that have hung on to fashion through the years. If practicality were all, everyone would be in uniform. Clothes have, in fact, never been more important to a greater proportion of the population than they are today. As they move out of the home into the work force, women depend on their apparel as they do on hair styling and makeup to help them face the world in the best possible way. The distinction between the working woman today and 30 years ago is that in the 1950's she aped the dress of the leisured woman, wearing hats and jewelry on the job, and not caring about the upkeep on her clothes. Today almost all women are working in some way, even if their efforts are in the charity field and not for a paycheck. Efficient and Effective This perception has eluded the majority of European fashion designers, who still think in terms of astonishing cuts and seductive designs when they prepare their collections. The vast majority of women no longer think of themselves as clothes horses or care about being the first on their block with whatever is the shock fashion of the moment. Whether working or not, they want their clothes to be efficient as well as effective. It is their understanding of this attitude that has given American designers increasing status on the world fashion market. The collections for fall and winter, shown on Seventh Avenue during the last two weeks, drew many representatives of foreign retail organizations and the press, seeking directions for the new season.  Once they limited their search to the salons of Paris, and to a certain extent Italian fashion centers. Now they look for a certain reality factor in the New York collections. For a long time, American fashion houses looked abroad for their own directions. Paris was the arbiter of hemlines, for example, until London usurped the role with its miniskirts of the early 1960's. But it wasn't until French designers such as Pierre Cardin and Andre Courreges bared the knees that short skirts swept the world. There is still a ripple effect from French designs. Let Yves Saint Laurent show a bellhop jacket or Karl Lagerfeld lengthen a skirt and the world follows. World-Class Contestants But a number of New York designers are world-class contestants in the fashion race. Ralph Lauren's preoccupation with the Old West has brought cowboys and Indians to the attention of designers in all of Europe's fashion centers. Calvin Klein's focus on uncomplicated, almost minimalist designing has similarly brought him worldwide attention. Both these designers have also concentrated on tailored clothes for next season, making possible a look that is neat and composed with long skirts and less yardage. They are suitable for any woman who wants to look put together with a minimum of stress. This focus on daytime tailoring, evident in dresses as well as suits, sets off the American designers from the European, who tend to keep most of their sparks for evening. John Anthony has demonstrated that he can also handle tailoring in a contemporary manner, keeping his clothes supple and easy, and Bill Blass, who is no slouch when it comes to evening clothes, cannot be matched when it comes to classic daytime cuts.

In casual clothes, the sportswear field, which is America's main contribution to world fashion, Perry Ellis through much of his collection provided the totally relaxed look that is his signature in fabrics of extreme luxury. But the most dazzling collection was that of Geoffrey Beene, who perfected ideas with which he has been working for some seasons and who has developed the technique that makes them come off. Never self-indulgent, he made clothes that worked for the purpose for which they were intended. It was impossible to trace a source, other than in his own collections, for any of his styles. There were no period pieces, just clothes for today. A Medley for Daytime Mr. Beene's day clothes were a medley of tweeds in subtle colors, canvas for raincoats and suede for accent. His evening styles, often in startling juxtapositions of fabrics, the thinnest someimes anchored in places by areas of quilting, were fluid and flawless. The clothes didn't look ''designed'' in the sense that someone had forced the materials into preconceived forms and built up the shape by a serious inner structure. Rather they seemed to take the shape that was implicit in the way the fabrics fell when they were draped and therefore purveyed a sense of inevitability. The mixture of lace with satin or tweed, the restrained introduction of fabrics that glittered and the occasional introduction of a flowered print produced some ravishing clothes. The designer had his ideas - and his materials - so well in hand that it is impossible to recall any duds. What made the collection work so well is that he was not concerned with distorting the human body in any way. His aim was to produce clothes that could be worn effortlessly and comfortably, in the modern manner. In accomplishing that, Mr. Beene redefined American fashion.","Fashion is in transition. The contest is not between long or short skirts, narrow or full skirts or 1950's hourglass styles versus 1960's rectangular shapes. It is between clothes for leisured, moneyed women who use them as a symbol of their social status and women who think of fashion in a functional way. This does not preclude flattery, femininity and all the other attributes that have hung on to fashion through the years. If practicality were all, everyone would be in uniform. Clothes have, in fact, never been more important to a greater proportion of the population than they are today. As they move out of the home into the work force, women depend on their apparel as they do on hair styling and makeup to help them face the world in the best possible way. The distinction between the working woman today and 30 years ago is that in the 1950's she aped the dress of the leisured woman, wearing hats and jewelry on the job, and not caring about the upkeep on her clothes. Today almost all women are working in some way, even if their efforts are in the charity field and not for a paycheck. Efficient and Effective This perception has eluded the majority of an fashion designers, who still think in terms of astonishing cuts and seductive designs when they prepare their collections. The vast majority of women no longer think of themselves as clothes horses or care about being the first on their block with whatever is the shock fashion of the moment. Whether working or not, they want their clothes to be efficient as well as effective. It is their understanding of this attitude that has given n designers increasing status on the world fashion market. The collections for fall and winter, shown on Seventh Avenue during the last two weeks, drew many representatives of foreign retail organizations and the press, seeking directions for the new season.  Once they limited their search to the salons of , and to a certain extent Italian fashion centers. Now they look for a certain reality factor in the  collections.

"NYT",1983,"Germany","AMERICANS LEAD EAST GERMANS IN TRACK","For most of the 15,829 spectators in the 92,000-seat Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum today, a strong performance by the American women overshadowed a world record of 72 feet 10 3/4 inches in the men's shot-put by Udo Beyer of East Germany. A year ago, the United States women's track and field team won only two events in two days against East Germany. Today, when this year's meet began, the American women won three of their nine events and broke two American records and one American all-comers record. As a result, the United States took a 108-100 lead over East Germany in men's and women's combined scoring. The American men, led by Steve Scott, Edwin Moses, Tom Petranoff and Carl Lewis, won eight of their 11 events and led the East German men, 70-46. The East German women led the American women, 54-38. The American women's records were set by Louise Ritter in the high jump (6 feet 6 3/4 inches) and the United States 400-meter relay team (41.63 seconds, only three-hundredths of a second slower than East Germany's 1980 world record). But the performance of the day came from the 27-year-old Beyer, a mountain of a man at 6 feet 4 1/4 inches and 286 pounds. Two days ago, while working out here, he stepped into a hole near a shot-put ring and hurt his left ankle. But he said he never doubted he would compete, though he also said, ''I was just hoping to win.'' He won and also broke his 1978 world record of 72-8. In 1969, when East German shot-putters placed one, two, three in the European championships, Beyer decided to be a shot-putter, too.  He was then 6 feet 3/4 inch and 181 pounds. Two years later, he was the East German junior champion in the shot-put, discus throw and hammer throw. He is such a good athlete that in recent years he has run 100 meters in 11.2 seconds, high-jumped 6-4 1/2 and long jumped 22-5 3/4 inches, astounding accomplishments for so large a man. And he does not lack confidence. Last year, the first time he competed against Dave Laut, the American shot-put champion, he won. Then he asked Laut, ''What do you think of me?'' Laut finished second here with 71-9, a distance only he, Beyer and two others have ever exceeded.  ''It is difficult to throw 71-9 and lose,'' said Laut. ''I mean, 71-9 isn't exactly stinking the place up.'' Beyer's victory was cheered by his 22-year-old sister, Gisela.  Between Udo's attempts, Gisela won the women's discus throw with 230 feet. In the women's 400 relay, Chandra Cheeseborough gave the United States a 3-meter lead on the third leg of the relay, and Evelyn Ashford held that margin to the finish against Marlies Gohr . Miss Ashford was so happy that three steps after the finish she spiked the baton like a football. She had a right to be happy. In the day's first running event, the women's 100-meter dash, Mrs. Gohr beat her by a meter in 11.39 seconds. The time was impressive, considering the headwind of 6.41 miles an hour. ''I had a very good start,'' said Mrs. Gohr after the 100.  ''Ashford had no chance against me today.'' The East Germans had a chance in the women's 1,500 meters, though Mary Decker led from the start. But when Miss Decker shifted gears on the last lap, she ran off to an 8-meter victory. She covered the last 400 meters in 60.3 seconds, exceptionally fast, and her time of 3 minutes 59.93 seconds was the fastest ever on American soil. Scott and Mary Decker Win ''It was obvious that they wanted me to lead from the start,'' said Miss Decker. ''I just did not want to get trapped. This is the smartest race I have run in a long time.'' Scott won the men's 1,500 the way Miss Decker won the women's - with an all-out last lap. Scott regained the lead with 40 meters left and beat Andreas Busse of East Germany by 5 feet in 3:39.45.  Scott ran the last 400 meters in 52.6 seconds. Moses won the 400-meter hurdles by 5 meters in 48.46 seconds, his 76th straight victory in this event since 1977. Uncharacteristically, he knocked down the last of the 10 hurdles. ''It was due to my lack of concentration and the newness of the track,'' said Moses. Javelin Throwers Excel Petranoff, the new world record-holder in the javelin throw, rallied to beat Detlef Michel of East Germany, 310 feet 5 inches to 302-1. Petranoff's winning throw was the seventh-longest ever, and this was only the second time that two javelin throwers had exceeded 300 feet in one meet. Last weekend, Lewis won the 100-meter and 200-meter dashes and the long jump in the USA/Mobil outdoor championships in Indianapolis.  That qualified him for four events here, including the 400-meter relay. He chose to run only the relay, and he won it for the United States. Lewis was 3 meters behind when he got the baton on the anchor leg.  With 30 meters left, he still trailed Frank Emmelmann of East Germany by 1 1/2 meters. Then, with his huge stride, he caught up with 10 meters left and won by a foot in 38.71 seconds. ''I knew the Germans had a very good team,'' said Lewis. ''I felt I had to take the responsibility for any mistakes made during the race, since I am the national champion. I thought I would get him, even when there was 50 meters to go.'' East German Wins 400 The upset of the day came in the men's 400-meter dash, where Thomas Schoenlebe of East Germany overtook Eliot Tabron of the United States and beat him by a foot in 45.2 seconds, his fastest ever. Schoenlebe became 18 years old three weeks ago. Last year, he said, he watched this meet in East Germany as a spectator. The United States-East German meet was part of the three-day Los Angeles Times/TAC International Summer Games. It was followed immediately today, and will be followed Sunday, by a 31-nation meet designed to allow American and foreign athletes to run on the track that will be used for next summer's Olympic Games. Alice Smith, who ran the first leg of the women's 400-meter relay for the United States against East Germany, returned in the international all-comers meet and won the 100-meter dash in 11.08 seconds. Craig Masback won the men's 1,500 meters in 3:40.53.  Vladimir Kiselev of the Soviet Union, the 1980 Olympic champion in the men's shot-put, finished seventh here with 64 feet 8 3/4 inches.","For most of the 15,829 spectators in the 92,000-seat  Memorial Coliseum today, a strong performance by the  women overshadowed a world record of 72 feet 10 3/4 inches in the men's shot-put by   of .

"NYT",1988,"Afghanistan","An Afghan Exile, Her School and Hopes for Future","''No one has been brave enough to help the women,'' Tajwar Kakar said. ''No one has even tried. This is not Afghan culture. This is not how I was raised to behave in my country.'' Mrs. Kakar leaned forward as she spoke of the past and the future in Afghanistan and her present exile, where a conservative Islamic current has swept many Afghan refugee women behind the veil, into seclusion. She unconsciously let her own veil fall as she spoke of her work as principal of the Lycee Malalai, a secondary school for Afghan refugee girls in Peshawar, and her anxieties about the role of women in a possibly Islamic state of Afghanistan after the war ends. The school, offering one of the handful of opportunities for higher education for Afghan girls, has helped Mrs. Kakar gain a measure of grudging support from Afghan political parties in Peshawar. But Mrs. Kakar, a 38-year-old refugee from northern Afghanistan, has also suffered criticism from other refugees, many of whom consider the emancipation of women a Communist tactic. Westerners who have studied Afghan society, as well as many Afghan men, say education for women has been damaged by its association with the Communist coup and the subsequent Kabul regimes. Western Clothes and Jobs In prewar Afghanistan, most towns and villages had elementary schools for girls, and in the major cities education was easily available through university level. Women wore Western clothes and held a wide range of jobs. The Government that took power after the coup in April 1978 immediately associated itself with feminism and fought tradition by pushing for coeducation and the unveiling of all women. Women's groups became propaganda tools for the Kabul regime and literacy training was politicized with Marxist ideology, said Margaret Segal, the director of Afghan education for the International Rescue Committee, an American voluntary organization in Peshawar. In the classroom, set behind 10-foot compound walls, a 15-year-old student in a green school uniform and a white veil sat with her classmates talking about the morning's exams and the future in Afghanistan. ''I want to be a judge,'' said the girl, Seroza. ''My friends, they want to be engineers, pilots, police officers.'' Worry About Their Rights Tajwar Kakar, her teachers and her students are an educated minority among the more than 800,000 Afghan women who make up about 30 percent of the refugees who have fled to Pakistan over the last eight years. They consider themselves pioneers for the new generation of women. Yet they worry that the dominance of Islamic fundamentalists in the war, and the Islamic influence in a future government, will curtail their rights. While eight years of war have in a sense broken down ethnic and tribal barriers and created a sense of national identity, refugee life and the turmoil of war have strengthened Islamic orthodoxy and limited women's contact with the outside world. Education, Mrs. Kakar says, will break down walls. ''If women have an education they will know that in the Koran they are equal to men and they will fight for these rights,'' she said. ''If we don't have the right to work, how can we rebuild Afghanistan?'' Although all the guerrilla parties in Peshawar advocate education for men and women, in practice the parties have identified with traditionalist and anti-feminist values. Mrs. Kakar has made her work into a fight against those values. From Childhood to Torture She described her own childhood: Her father, a government official, supplemented his daughter's education by taking her to political meetings and teaching her to shoot, as well as encouraging her to read Jack London. An orphan at 11, she was married at 14 and raised three of her seven children before getting her high school diploma. She was a teacher before she was arrested in 1981 by the Kabul Government, then tortured during a year in prison. Her brow furrows when she tells how she was hung by the hair and subjected to electric shock. But she dismisses that year with a wave of the hand as she speaks of her students' dreams and her school's problems. The Lycee Malalai, named after an Afghan Joan of Arc who spurred her land's soldiers to victory against the British in the late 19th century, was founded in the spring of 1986 with the help of the International Rescue Committee after Mrs. Kakar's requests for aid from other voluntary organizations and the guerrilla parties had repeatedly been rebuffed. The school, which started with 25 students, now has more than 100; it offers free education and a complete curriculum in math, sciences, religion and four languages. But constant reminders of the school's tenuous position come in the form of letters and phone calls threatening to bomb the school and kill Mrs. Kakar and her family. She Shrugs Off the Threats ''The first step toward the Communist coup was the introduction of coeducation in Afghanistan,'' reads one such letter. ''Consequently the Moslem youth came to forget about Islam and were sunk in the corruption emerged from coeducation. It is the obligation of every combatant Moslem to eliminate the centers of corruption.'' Mrs. Kakar shrugs off the threats, saying they come from a small minority of uneducated Afghans. But her children - in particular her 20-year-old daughter, Farida, a student at the school - worry about her and about the school's future. Massoud Khalili, the political officer of Jamiat-Islami, one of the seven parties that Westerners refer to as fundamentalist, offered one view: ''Socially, I think that the Afghan people are moderate people. They have never practiced fanaticism in their life. A Government like Iran couldn't last a year in Afghanistan.'' ''I can't say that women will be free right away,'' he added. ''I think it will be a gradual process.'' Mrs. Kakar uses Islamic values to help gain support for her goals. Pointing out that the prophet Mohammed was an active proponent of women's rights, she accuses people who want to seclude women of cultural repression and violations of Islamic law. ''I believe God will protect me,'' Mrs. Kakar said. ''Everything I want is in Islam, so no one can tell me what to do.''","''No one has been brave enough to help the women,'' Tajwar  said.

"NYT",2012,"Afghanistan","An Afghan Trail of Mystery After a U.S. Adviser's Slaying","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Sergeant Nargis went to work Monday with murder on her mind. By the end of the morning, she would succeed, becoming responsible for this year's 62nd insider killing, in which Afghan security forces have killed American or other coalition personnel. Such killings have greatly increased this year, but Sergeant Nargis's killing of an American police adviser, Joseph Griffin, 49, of Mansfield, Ga., ranks among the strangest. Was she an Iranian agent, as Afghan officials suggested on Tuesday after they found her Iranian passport at home? Was she mentally ill, as some police interrogators said privately and other Afghan officials speculated publicly? The first theories, that she was either a jilted lover or a Taliban infiltrator, were firmly rejected by the authorities on Tuesday, but even her interrogators were left perplexed by her motives. Making the case even stranger was her job: a uniformed police officer attached to the Interior Ministry's legal and gender equality unit, what would normally be seen as a plum job, one that is entirely underwritten by international aid, both American and European, earmarked specifically for women's rights issues. All she would tell her interrogators was that she went to work aiming to kill someone important, and that she did not much care who, officials said. ''I was myself asking her, trying to make her talk about what could make her do such a thing, and all she would say was she wanted to kill a high official,'' said Gen. Mohammad Zaher, the director of the criminal investigation division of the Police Department in Kabul Province, who attended her interrogation after her arrest on Monday. What she would not say, however, was why she had done it, he said. ''We just don't know.'' Her first stop was the Interior Ministry compound in downtown Kabul, where her own office was. General Zaher said she had told questioners that she prowled the compound looking for someone important enough to kill. ''She saw two foreign women on the grounds of the M.O.I., and thought of killing them,'' he said. They were foreign aid workers who had been gathering warm clothing for refugee children and were looking for police assistance in distributing it. ''She said she thought they were not worth killing.'' So instead she went down the street and around the corner, about half a mile away, to the sprawling compound that includes the Kabul police headquarters and the Kabul governor's office. There, according to Afghan officials and to what they said was her own confession, she gained access by hiding her weapon on her body -- women are searched much less thoroughly because of cultural norms, and only by other women, who are often in short supply. As an official of the gender unit at the ministry, she probably had experience carrying out such searches herself and would know how to evade them. Afghan security officials themselves have a well-founded fear of attacks by their own forces -- ''green on green,'' or Afghan on Afghan, attacks have been even more common lately than attacks on foreign forces, with at least 14 Afghan police officers killed in such episodes in the past week. So even a uniformed police officer could not easily gain access to a building where she was not assigned. According to the general's account, she first went to the restroom inside police headquarters, where she removed the gun from under her clothing and put it in her uniform pocket, where it would be more accessible. She then tried to get into the Kabul governor's office, but was turned away by guards there because she had no appointment. Next she tried the Kabul police chief's office, and again was turned away. She told interrogators she had wanted to kill either of them. Sergeant Nargis went downstairs to the ground floor, determined to kill someone immediately now that her gun was no longer hidden and she would be caught with it if she tried to leave. That was when she encountered Mr. Griffin, an employee of DynCorp International who had been working with the Afghan police as a trainer since July 2011. Afghan officials said he had just bought an Afghan flag at a canteen in the police headquarters, for some sort of ceremony. According to police accounts, she went up behind Mr. Griffin and shot him in the head at close range without any warning. Although he died at the scene, Afghan officials said, he was taken by medical personnel to an American base. As more detail about Sergeant Nargis emerged, it did little to shed any light on her motive. Afghan officials at a news conference produced a copy of her Iranian passport, which showed she was 33 years old and, as with many Muslim women in conservative areas, had only one name of her own. She was a native of Iran, the officials said, and married an Afghan refugee in Tehran 10 years ago before moving to Afghanistan with him. He got a job as a low-level employee -- a tea boy, or servant -- at another department of the Interior Ministry. (Some officials said on Monday that he was a police officer, though that proved untrue.) Sergeant Nargis joined one of the first classes of female police recruits in 2008, and would have had a much higher income than her husband. Officials produced no evidence that Sergeant Nargis had any recent connection with the Iranian authorities, though there was plenty of innuendo, and some Afghan news outlets ran with the theory that she was an infiltrator. Blaming neighboring countries for atrocities in Afghanistan is a common refrain here, not less so because it sometimes proves to be true. She and her husband, whose name had not been released, have three children, the eldest a son in his final year of high school, the authorities said. The husband was being detained as a witness but had not been charged with any crime. Intriguingly, Sergeant Nargis returned to Afghanistan less than a month ago from a monthlong police training program in Egypt. While on that course with other female officers, she disappeared for two days without ever giving a satisfactory explanation for her movements, according to a police official who spoke to other police officers who had been with her. The official spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to release information about the case. The only thing Afghan officials seemed to be certain of was that Sergeant Nargis was not a Taliban infiltrator. Even the Taliban did not claim as much, in a statement issued by the group quoting a spokesman, Zabiullah Mujahid, and reported by the monitoring organization SITE Intelligence Group on Monday. But Mr. Mujahid did add that such attacks had been on the increase not only by Taliban infiltrators, but also by ''Afghan soldiers who have an awakened conscience and feeling against the occupation forces.'' That last theory resonated with one police commander close to the case. Either that, he said, or ''she was just nuts.''",",  --  went to work Monday with murder on her mind.

"WP",2011,"Afghanistan","As priorities shift, U.S. steps back from goals for Afghan women","When the U.S. Agency for International Development sought bids last March for a $140 million land reform program in Afghanistan, it insisted that the winning contractor meet specific goals to promote women's rights: The number of deeds granting women title had to increase by 50 percent; there would have to be regular media coverage on women's land rights; and teaching materials for secondary schools and universities would have to include material on women's rights. Before the contract was awarded, USAID overhauled the initiative, stripping out those concrete targets. Now, the contractor only has to perform ""a written evaluation of Afghan inheritance laws,"" assemble ""summaries of input from women's groups"" and draft amendments to the country's civil code. The removal of specific women's rights requirements, which also took place in a $600 million municipal government program awarded last year, reflects a shift in USAID's approach in Afghanistan. Instead of setting ambitious goals to improve the status of Afghan women, the agency is tilting toward more attainable measures. ""If you're targeting an issue, you need to target it in a way you can achieve those objectives,"" said J. Alexander Thier, director of USAID's Office of Afghanistan and Pakistan Affairs. ""The women's issue is one where we need hardheaded realism. There are things we can do, and do well. But if we become unrealistic and overfocused . . . we get ourselves in trouble."" A senior U.S. official involved in Afghanistan policy said changes to the land program also stem from a desire at the top levels of the Obama administration to triage the war and focus on the overriding goal of ending the conflict. ""Gender issues are going to have to take a back seat to other priorities,"" said the senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations. ""There's no way we can be successful if we maintain every special interest and pet project. All those pet rocks in our rucksack were taking us down."" The changes come at a time of growing concern among rights advocates that the modest gains Afghan women have achieved since the fall of the Taliban government in 2001 are being rolled back. New rules being drafted by President Hamid Karzai's government would bar private safe houses for women who are fleeing abuse and place new rules on those seeking refuge in the country's 14 public shelters, including forcing women to submit to medical examinations and evicting them if their families want them back. The proposed rules would also bring the shelters - funded by international organizations, Western governments and private donors - under the direct control of the Afghan government. Women's advocates say the restrictions on shelters, which have been embraced by religious conservatives sympathetic to the Taliban, are an early sign of the compromises the Karzai government is willing to make to reach a peace deal with insurgents. The advocates fear that reconciliation with the Taliban - a goal supported by the U.S. government - will result in a significant erosion of women's rights. In an effort to mollify those concerns, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clintonpromised last month that the United States ""will not  . . .  support a political process that undoes the social progress that has been made in the past decade."" Despite the changes in the land reform program, USAID says it is not backing down from helping Afghan women. The agency recently issued a new strategy that calls for incorporating assistance to women into all of its Afghan programs. ""The women of Afghanistan find themselves disconnected from one another, lacking opportunities to participate in the political and economic life of the nation,"" the strategy states. ""We must support the women of Afghanistan as agents of change."" Women's land rights USAID's land reform program was intended to address one important but little-recognized cause of conflict in Afghanistan: the lack of clear property ownership records, which is a result of decades of warfare and the absence of an effective government. Titles to the same plots of land were handed to different people by a succession of governments and local warlords. Squatters have exploited the vacuum of authority to claim abandoned farmland. Fearful of eviction if the central government is able to regain control of contested areas, many turn to the Taliban for protection. But USAID also sought to remedy another problem. In soliciting bids for the land program last March, the agency said that ""women in Afghanistan have few rights to inherit, obtain or transfer land."" It said the initiative, called Land Reform in Afghanistan, was ""expressly designed to enhance and improve land use and ownership rights of women."" To achieve that goal, USAID insisted that the winning contractor conduct several specific activities. They included establishing a strategy for augmenting women's rights, building a legal-aid system for women, distributing public-education material that advises women of their rights, and implementing incentives for registrars to ensure that marital property is registered in the names of both spouses. ""What was specified would have resulted in a very robust program,"" said an executive with a development firm that implements gender programs for USAID. The executive, like other development specialists working for USAID who were interviewed for this story, did not want to be identified, citing concerns that their comments could affect their relationship with the agency. But the agency canceled the bid solicitation a few weeks later. Senior officials at the State Department thought the program, like many other USAID efforts in Afghanistan, did not involve enough collaboration with the Afghan government. The redesigned program, which was put out for bids in September, focuses on strengthening and supporting the Afghan Land Authority, a government institution that barely rated a mention in the first document. The new objective, USAID wrote, was to ""create Afghan capacity to successfully design, manage and implement needed land reform."" Among the most significant changes was the section on women. Gone were all of the specific activities listed in the original bid document. The new program emphasizes analysis over action. ""If support can be found"" in the Afghan government, USAID wrote, "". . . the Consultant should study the issue of inheritance to determine if it would be possible to amend the inheritance laws to give women greater access to land upon the deaths of their fathers, husbands or sons."" The winning contractor, Vermont-based Tetra Tech ARD, has only three requirements when it comes to women: to examine and summarize provisions in the country's civil code dealing with female inheritance; to meet with Afghan women's groups and other organizations ""as needed/appropriate to obtain an Afghan perspective""; and to draft amendments to the civil code reforming women's inheritance laws. But the document says that, given the lack of enforcement of inheritance portions of the code, ""meaningful reform may not be possible."" As USAID seeks to work more closely with Afghans, women's advocates worry that Afghan officials will use their new influence to soften requirements. ""There's a need to strengthen the capacity of the Afghan government, but that can't be done at the expense of weakening women's rights and access,"" said Ritu Sharma, the president of Women Thrive Worldwide, a Washington-based advocacy organization. Like many other women's rights advocates, she had not learned about the revisions to the program until contacted by a reporter. Thier said the revised program was not ""a deliberate attempt to get away from women's issues."" The changes, he said, were a result of a shift in the program's focus. But he also noted that USAID had ""feasibility concerns"" about the initial requirements. ""It was just seen as overreaching in terms of what would be realistic,"" he said. 'Secondary' concern? A similar shift in requirements also took place in a large program that aims to improve municipal governments across the country. When USAID sought bids for the initiative, it specified that the contractor would have to ""employ a gender specialist with sufficient expertise,"" ""develop and implement a gender strategy that supports the inclusion of women in municipal governance,"" ""implement gender awareness courses"" and ""provide technical, functional, managerial and leadership training for women in relevant areas of municipal governance."" That program also was revised. When it was reissued, gender was no longer a line item in the contract. Instead, it was listed as one of three ""cross-cutting themes."" It did state, however, that ""gender concerns should be incorporated into all aspects of the program."" Thier said USAID, which allocated $228 million to help Afghan women in fiscal 2010, has ""no intention of diminishment in support for gender"" in the municipal governance program. He said that it retains a goal of increasing female participation in municipal government to 30 percent of the workforce. The new program, he said, simply aims to be ""less prescriptive"" in how the goal is achieved. But a development specialist who works on gender issues for USAID and has reviewed both bid documents said the original program was ""much stronger when it comes to women."" The revised program has a greater focus on providing basic services to the population - a key element of the U.S. counterinsurgency strategy. ""The focus is no longer on building capacity, because we have to stem the insurgency,"" the specialist said. ""At times like that, gender becomes secondary."" USAID officials emphasize that their programs have contributed to significant improvements for Afghan women. The agency has paid for the training of about 1,500 midwives, which has helped to reduce infant mortality. The agency's support for primary education has helped to increase the number of girls in school from almost zero in 2001 to more than 2.5 million. Despite deep opposition to women working outside the home, or even continuing schooling after puberty - in rural southern Afghanistan, a common expression among men is that ""a woman's place is in the home or in the ground"" - USAID is trying to chip away at those attitudes by providing micro-credit for women to start businesses, teaching them to make handicrafts at home and encouraging them to participate in civil society groups. ""We have had real, fundamental results in the investments we've made in the meat-and-potatoes approach to women's empowerment that gets them in school, keeps them healthy and gradually gets them to have economic opportunity,"" Thier said. But he noted that higher-profile issues, such as governance and land reform, have been more challenging for the United States to promote. ""There's a certain amount of radioactivity in our engagement,"" he said. ""It's the Afghans who need to lead that charge."" But the senior U.S. official said domestic fatigue is also a factor. ""Nobody wants to abandon the women of Afghanistan, but most Americans don't want to keep fighting there for years and years,"" the official said. ""The grim reality is that, despite all of the talk about promoting women's rights, things are going to have to give."" chandrasek@washpost.com","When the  sought bids last March for a $140 million land reform program in , it insisted that the winning contractor meet specific goals to promote women's rights: The number of deeds granting women title had to increase by 50 percent; there would have to be regular media coverage on women's land rights; and teaching materials for secondary schools and universities would have to include material on women's rights.

"NYT",2001,"Switzerland","Balthus, Painter Whose Suggestive Figures Caused a Stir, Is Dead at 92","Balthasar Klossowski, the painter internationally known as Balthus, died yesterday at his chalet in La Rossiniere, Switzerland, near Gstaad. He was 92. For the last 30 years of his long life, Balthus was among the most widely admired of European painters. He had excelled as a portraitist (notably of his painter colleagues Andre Derain and Joan Miro), as a painter of French landscapes in a tradition that went back to Nicolas Poussin, and as someone who had given a whole new spin to the notion of Parisian townscape. When painting still lifes, he could stress the violence implicit in the presence of hammer and knife among the apparatus of everyday activities. (It was not for nothing that in Paris he was a close friend of Antonin Artaud, proponent of the ""theater of cruelty."") He could depict a game of cards as a pastime with overtones of desperation. Balthus was also admired as a stage designer for Shakespeare's ""As You Like It,"" Shelley's ""Cenci"" (as adapted by Artaud), Albert Camus's ""Etat de Siege"" and Mozart's ""Cosi Fan Tutte."" In Emily Bronte's ""Wuthering Heights,"" he found inspiration in 1934 and '35 for a long series of drawings, more than one of which rivaled the singular mood of Bronte herself in its portrayal of a frenetic wooing between young people. But above all, Balthus was known for paintings of equivocal figure subjects, very young women in poses or situations that were regarded as enigmatic or suggestive or both. Often these subjects were caught between dream and waking. Sometimes there were more explicitly sexual elements, and these caused a minor scandal as early as 1934, when he had his first one-man show at the Galerie Pierre in Paris. Though never wholly discarded, the element of erotic provocation became more oblique in his later work. (""I used to want to shock,"" he once told a friend, ""but now it bores me."") In 1955, he even agreed to tone down an erotic incident in ""The Street"" (1933), a painting that had been bought by James Thrall Soby, one of his earliest American admirers, who later bequeathed it to the Museum of Modern Art in Manhattan. ""I really don't understand why people see the paintings of girls as Lolitas,"" he told the chief art critic of The New York Times, Michael Kimmelman, in 1996. ""My little model is absolutely untouchable to me. Some American journalist said he found my work pornographic. What does he mean? Everything now is pornographic. Advertising is pornographic. You see a young woman putting on some beauty product who looks like she's having an orgasm. I've never made anything pornographic. Except perhaps 'The Guitar Lesson.' "" That large painting, exhibited in the 1934 show at the Galerie Pierre, depicts a girl naked below the waist and slumped over the knees of a bare-breasted woman, who evidently is her teacher. A guitar is on the floor and a piano is in the background. But the figure of the girl, it has been pointed out, most directly echoes the dead Christ in the 15th-century Avignon Pieta in the Louvre; it's a link, it has been argued, that by its blasphemy heightens the shock. ""I absolutely never thought of that, never,"" Balthus protested in the 1996 interview. ""I'm Catholic. I'm a member of the Order of St. Maurice and St. Lazare!"" Among painters, poets, novelists, theater people and fashionable hostesses in Paris, Balthus never ceased to be admired as an artist and sought out as a companion. But after the scandal of 1934 he did not have another exhibition in Paris until after World War II. From his school days onward, Balthus was drawn to the apple-green uplands of the Bernese Oberland. That fascination found apotheosis in 1937 in the large painting ""The Mountain,"" which is now at the Metropolitan Museum of Art. Against a jagged and rocky backdrop, three young people, locked in daydreams of their own devising, act out their notions of what life may have in store for them. It was not in Paris but in New York, at the Pierre Matisse Gallery in 1938, that Balthus showed his work in great strength and began to be sought after by American collectors and museums. From 1938 to 1977, his eight exhibitions at the gallery were major events in the New York art world, as were his exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art in 1956 and the major retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in 1984. Balthus never came to the United States, and for most of his life he lived either in Paris or in a succession of increasingly grand and often remote country houses in France, Switzerland and Italy. Even in Paris, he loved an august association and lived in a house in the Cour de Rohan that was once described as ""carved out of the huge vine-clad masonry of Philippe-Auguste's fortifications."" A house that suited him very well was the Chateau de Chassy, in the mountainous Morvan region in east-central France, where he lived from 1953 onward. In the paintings of that period, he brought a contemplative majesty to both outdoor and indoor life. There is in the big Chassy landscapes something of the four ""Seasons"" (in the Louvre) in which Poussin commemorated the rightness of nature and the presence in all natural things of a predestined order. Balthus's basically reclusive way of life was transformed in 1961, when at the invitation of Andre Malraux, then France's minister of culture, he became director of the French Academy in Rome. Among his predecessors in the post were Ingres and Berlioz. One of the great European town houses, the Villa Medici, went with the job. The architecture had Michelangelesque echoes, but the interior had badly deteriorated over generations of institutional use. During his 16 years of residence, Balthus restored an uncluttered nobility to the interior and made the 18-acre gardens look as they did when Velazquez painted them. In these restorations, almost as much as in the paintings on which he was working at the same time, a creativity peculiar to himself was at work. It was in the hallowed studios in the gardens of the Villa Medici that Balthus worked with a new medium (casein tempera on canvas) to produce the series of endlessly worked and reworked figure paintings that won him a whole new reputation. Many of them featured a young Japanese woman, Setusuko Ideta, whom he had met in Japan in 1962 and wed in 1967 after his first marriage had ended in divorce. He would work on some of these paintings for 6, 7 or even 10 years. Sometimes he would speak of them as ""utter failures, without exception"" that had been not so much ""finished"" as given up in despair. But like his friend the sculptor and painter Alberto Giacometti, he disliked the very notion of ""finish"" in art. After leaving Rome in 1977, Balthus, his wife and their daughter, Harumi, settled in a chalet near Gstaad. He is survived by his wife and daughter; two sons, Stanislas and Thaddeus, from his first marriage; and a brother, Pierre Klossowski, a painter and writer. At a time when the School of Paris was generally thought to be in decline, Balthus kept his position as a major European artist. Full-scale retrospectives were held at the Musee des Arts Decoratifs in Paris in 1966, at the Tate Gallery in London in 1968, at the Venice Biennale in 1980 and at the Spoleto Festival in Italy in 1982. After his work was exhibited in ""A New Spirit in Painting"" at the Royal Academy in London 1981, Balthus was invited to become a foreign member of the Academy. He had a major museum retrospective in Lausanne in 1993 and a lesser but significant exhibition of his drawings in Bern in 1994. Balthasar Klossowski was the second son of Erich Klossowski, a Polish-born art historian, painter and stage designer, and his wife, Elisabeth Dorothea Spiro, a painter who exhibited under the name Baladine. For political reasons, his family had left Poland in 1830 and eventually settled in Breslau, acquiring German citizenship there. Balthus's father made a name for himself in each of his activities, especially as the author of a comprehensive study of the work of Honore Daumier. His maternal grandfather was a cantor in Breslau and composed a great deal of music for religious services. In 1903 the family moved to Paris, mixing freely and happily in the worlds of painting, scholarship, poetry, theater and publishing there. Balthus was born on Feb. 29, 1908. The poet Rainer Maria Rilke once told him that being born on leap day was like slipping through a crack in time; it gave Balthus access to ""a kingdom independent of all the changes we undergo."" At the outbreak of World War I, the Klossowskis' status as enemy aliens caused them to move to Berlin, where they lived in straitened circumstances. As of 1917, Balthus's parents lived apart, and Balthus moved to Switzerland with his mother. They had a tiny apartment in Geneva, and Balthus spent summers above the Lake of Thun in a landscape to which he always returned with great pleasure. In 1919, Balthus's mother was befriended by Rilke, the foremost German poet of the day. Until his death in 1926, Rilke had an intense and continuous relationship with her and her two sons. In 1921, Rilke wrote a French text for the publication of ""Mitsou,"" a book of 40 ink drawings by the 13-year-old Balthus on the subject of a solitary boyhood. In its way a trial run for ideas that were to haunt Balthus's work for many years, the little book was described by the eminent German publisher Kurt Wolff as ""astounding and almost frightening."" It was also thanks largely to Rilke that when Balthus went to Paris at the age of 16 in 1924, many doors were open to him. He was welcomed by Andre Gide, the most influential writer of the day, and by Pierre Bonnard, Albert Marquet and Maurice Denis among painters. When Rilke came to Paris for five months in 1925, he dedicated his new poem, ""Narcisse,"" to Balthus. In 1926, with financial help from Rilke, Balthus spent a year traveling in Italy, where he made copies and sketches after Piero della Francesca, Masaccio, Masolino and others. Thereafter he spent much of his time in Paris, where he became friendly with Braque, Derain and Giacometti among artists, with Pierre Jean Jouve, Malraux and Paul Eluard among writers, and with Jean-Louis Barrault, Madeleine Renaud and others in the theater. Balthus married Antoinette de Watteville in Bern in 1937. In 1939, he was called up for service in the French Army and served near Saarbrucken before being discharged in December 1939. After the collapse of France to German forces, he and his wife lived on a farm in the French Savoie until 1942, when they moved to Switzerland and lived for some time in Fribourg. While waiting to return to Paris at war's end, Balthus lived for some time in the Villa Diodati, near Geneva, where Lord Byron had once lived. Balthus liked to fantasize about a supposed family connection between himself and Byron. After the death of his father in 1949 and of his mother in 1969, Balthus took advantage of what he believed to be his ancient and noble Polish lineage and asked to be called the Comte de Rola. Despite a lifelong horror of being photographed or interviewed, he became more accessible in his later years, though still deeply concerned with his privacy. He once said about himself, ""Balthus is a painter about whom nothing is known."" The often-quoted statement implied that whatever people thought they knew about him or his work was wrong.",", the painter internationally known as , died yesterday at his chalet in , , near . He was 92. For the last 30 years of his long life,  was among the most widely admired of European painters. He had excelled as a portraitist (notably of his painter colleagues  and ), as a painter of French landscapes in a tradition that went back to , and as someone who had given a whole new spin to the notion of ian townscape. When painting still lifes, he could stress the violence implicit in the presence of hammer and knife among the apparatus of everyday activities. (It was not for nothing that in  he was a close friend of , proponent of the ""theater of cruelty."") He could depict a game of cards as a pastime with overtones of desperation.  was also admired as a stage designer for 's ""As You Like It,"" 's ""Cenci"" (as adapted by ), 's ""Etat de Siege"" and 's ""Cosi Fan ."" In Emily 's ""Wuthering Heights,"" he found inspiration in 1934 and '35 for a long series of drawings, more than one of which rivaled the singular mood of  herself in its portrayal of a frenetic wooing between young people. But above all,  was known for paintings of equivocal figure subjects, very young women in poses or situations that were regarded as enigmatic or suggestive or both. Often these subjects were caught between dream and waking. Sometimes there were more explicitly sexual elements, and these caused a minor scandal as early as 1934, when he had his first one-man show at the  in . Though never wholly discarded, the element of erotic provocation became more oblique in his later work. (""I used to want to shock,"" he once told a friend, ""but now it bores me."") In 1955, he even agreed to tone down an erotic incident in ""The Street"" (1933), a painting that had been bought by , one of his earliest American admirers, who later bequeathed it to the Museum of Modern Art in . ""I really don't understand why people see the paintings of girls as Lolitas,"" he told the chief art critic of , , in 1996. ""My little model is absolutely untouchable to me. Some American journalist said he found my work pornographic. What does he mean? Everything now is pornographic. Advertising is pornographic.

WEST OF KABUL, EAST OF NEW YORK An Afghan American Story. By Tamim Ansary. 292 pp. New York: Farrar, Straus & Giroux. $22. Like many women who have reported on the Taliban, I have tried on a burka. It was in the Afghan market in the Pakistani city of Peshawar, a city of refugees and of long-simmering conflicts that reflect the larger battles in Afghanistan itself. There were no religious police in Peshawar to enforce the wearing of the burka as they were doing in Afghanistan, but still it was a common sight. The one I tried was the most everyday type -- a cheap, light-blue polyester affair with a vast pleated skirt that descended from a tight-fitting cap, a small mesh panel in front of the eyes providing the only light and air. I had wondered how women recognized each other; how a lost child ever found its mother; how friends and relatives could tell if they passed one another on the street. For those few moments under the burka, I glimpsed a life in which both air and vision were so restricted that I was overwhelmed by claustrophobia. It was suffocating, emotionally as well as physically. I took it off after half a minute. That instant when Afghan women lifted their burkas produced some of the most potent images of the liberation of Kabul last year. It seemed unambiguous. The Taliban, with their extreme and cruel misogyny, were defeated. Afghan women were free. But scarcely had the camera shutters clicked before ambiguities came crowding back. Today some Afghan women feel freer than before, others do not. Some feel that their lives and their futures have been restored to them, others struggle to survive in a country that has slipped back into chaos. And in Peshawar there are more refugees today than before the war against terrorism began. Among them are thousands of women, survivors of dead fathers, husbands and sons, still struggling for existence against impossible odds. The stories told in the three books under review -- Zoya's Story,"" ""My Forbidden Face"" and ""West of Kabul, East of New York"" -- illustrate many of the questions that the West needs to answer if Afghanistan is to emerge from this latest round of warfare in a better state than before. A little reflection on the long battle over the bodies and souls of Afghan women raises one question in particular: Was this a battle between secularism and Islam or between tradition and modernity? Two of these books are written by young women who lived under the Taliban -- both using pseudonyms here -- the third by an Afghan-American man who became famous overnight for an e-mail message he sent to 20 friends in the wake of Sept. 11 that was rapidly copied and sent on until it reached, he estimates, hundreds of thousands of people. These feel like familiar stories -- examples of a well-established genre, even: the personal account that illustrates the wider political context. It does not diminish their particularity to say that they are illustrative rather than revelatory, reinforcing what we feel we understand rather than shedding new light or bringing new understanding. The Taliban's treatment of women was well known before Sept. 11, not least because of the efforts of the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan, known as RAWA, which figures large in ""Zoya's Story."" Zoya's account, written with the assistance of two journalists, John Follain and Rita Cristofari, illuminates the clandestine resistance, first to the mujahedeen and then to the Taliban, that many intellectuals engaged in. Both her parents were active in clandestine politics -- her mother as a member of RAWA and her father in an unnamed underground organization. But it was only when her parents disappeared that Zoya came to understand the risks they had run. She was left with only a surrogate grandmother to take care of her, and with RAWA's help, the two managed to escape from the Taliban's Afghanistan. It's clear from all three accounts that the Taliban were only the most recent oppressors of Afghan women, whose suffering is in part the result of the conflict between modernity and tradition in which the West has, on occasion, been on the wrong side. More recently, both women and girls have suffered the fate of being the most vulnerable members of a society destroyed by more than 20 years of war. All three of these memoirs are written from exile, in which the vanished Afghanistan of childhood takes on the cast of a lost idyll. In ""West of Kabul, East of New York,"" Tamim Ansary's account of growing up between his father's Afghan world and his mother's America, the author conjures up a lost Afghan world of extended families who lived in the private interior of the courtyard -- closed against the outside but linked to other clan families by ties of blood and belonging. In the compound, he writes, everyone shared the same space and within its walls women lived freely. To go from one compound to another they were veiled and escorted. It was a traditional world, but one that was flexible enough to accommodate Ansary's American mother and her exotic ways. ""The family took her in as the Permanent Guest, always to be honored, loved and cared for. Afghan society settled on treating her as an exception to the rules of gender: she was considered neither female nor male, but American."" The Ansary family were among the well-to-do urban middle class competing for education and government jobs at a time when the royal family -- in the person of Mohammad Zahir Shah, the Afghan monarch, and his cousin Mohammad Daoud Khan, the prime minister -- were trying to modernize Afghanistan. In 1959, Daoud had challenged Afghanistan's religious leaders to show him the passage in the Koran that said women must be veiled. When they failed, he declared the veil un-Islamic. Shortly thereafter, the women of the royal family bared their faces in public. The progressive middle classes welcomed it. The mullahs and the rural traditionalists saw it as a breach of traditional values that had to be resisted at all costs. Daoud's government did other things that stirred resistance in Afghanistan and in neighboring Pakistan. He deposed the king and declared a republic, turning to the Soviet Union for assistance in modernizing Afghanistan. He tried to inaugurate coeducation -- Ansary's school was one of the first to allow girls to study in the same room as boys -- and to create a modern Islamic society. Women in the cities could wear Western dress, go to the cinema, study at the university and practice their professions. In the rural areas, though, they kept to the compound and the veil. The Marxist government that followed Daoud in 1979 decreed that girls should go to school and promoted the rights of Afghan women. The urban professional classes supported modernization but opposed the Soviet occupation for reasons of patriotism. The mullahs and the tribesmen were clearer -- they opposed both the reforms and the Soviet occupation. They had already declared holy war on the government, fighting to regain control both of their country and their women. With the entry of the Soviet Union, they got the support of Pakistan and the United States. With the Soviet retreat in 1989, the holy warriors had won their country back, if only to fight over it themselves. The women were next. All three accounts agree that the chaos that followed the Soviet withdrawal, as the various factions slugged it out for power, was the worst of times. Women were raped and murdered by the warlords and their men. All Afghanistan suffered through four years of brutality and chaos. When the Taliban conquered Kabul, many greeted the news with relief. At least a measure of order would be restored. Savage though the Taliban's treatment of women was, the mujahedeen had been as bad. In one of the most haunting passages of ""My Forbidden Face,"" Latifa describes the trauma of her brother, a student at Kabul University, who witnessed what happened during the departure of Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, at the time Pakistan's favored warlord and today still a menacing shadow over Afghanistan's future. When Hekmatyar's men ceded the university campus to Ahmed Shah Massoud of the Northern Alliance in 1992, among the souvenirs they abandoned was the naked body of a woman, bisected and nailed to either side of a pair of swinging doors. In that context, even public execution for adultery stands out a little less than it would in New York or London, though for Latifa and her family Taliban rule meant virtual house arrest. As is clear from her account (written with Shekeba Hachemi and translated from the French by Linda Coverdale), the three women of the household -- her mother, a retired doctor; her sister Soraya, a flight attendant; and Latifa, with her ambitions to be a journalist -- adjusted badly to this suddenly enforced purdah. ""This isn't clothing,"" Latifa writes of the first time she tried on a burka. ""It's a jail cell."" Her mother became depressed, her sister angry. Latifa alternated between the two. Eventually, though, they resisted -- her mother by treating patients in secret, Latifa by teaching girls in their home after the Taliban had banned them from school. Revolutionary movements born in fire incline to the repressive, of course, but there was a hatred and fear of women in the Taliban creed that went beyond even the revolutionary norm and differed from the brutalities of war. In his book ""Taliban,"" Ahmed Rashid observed that the Taliban were largely a generation of refugees who grew up in an almost exclusively male society in the camps of northern Pakistan. There, the world of extended family and life within the compound gates -- the world of women -- had been shattered. Or, as Ansary puts it in his memoir: ""They had never tasted how it was. They knew nothing of the lost world except for scattered phrases they heard from their fathers and uncles, who came out of Afghanistan rarely, and then on stretchers . . . choking out the words 'Son, always kill infidels; never let strangers see our women.' "" The word medieval was often used -- inappropriately -- to characterize the Taliban. They represented a third variant in the struggle for the Afghan soul: they rejected the Western (and the Soviet) vision of progress, but they were enemies, too, of the mujahedeen and of traditional tribal authority. Their vision of the state was hardly sophisticated, but to the degree that it demanded loyalty to a centralizing ideology rather than to a clan elder, it was closer to a 20th-century formulation than traditional rural society had been. Perversely, the Taliban became even more misogynist than the tribal leaders, perhaps precisely because they were free of tribal and family constraints. Latifa, Zoya and Ansary all come from the kind of families that supported the trend toward modernization of Afghan society that was interrupted in the late 1970's. Ansary's father had studied abroad on a government scholarship; Latifa's and Zoya's parents were liberal professionals. This secular, nonbelligerent middle class -- often left-wing -- could find no place under the mujahedeen or the Taliban. Some suffered internal exile, abandoning their professions in favor of raw survival. Others went abroad, where the fortunate made new lives while a few less favored were murdered, even outside Afghanistan, by fundamentalists who saw their ideas as a threat. One of the more famous such assassinations took the life of Meena, the young poet who founded the Revolutionary Association of the Women of Afghanistan in Kabul in 1977 to fight for women's emancipation. She was only 30 when she was murdered in Pakistan 10 years later. The organization she founded still educates girls in the refugee camps and promotes women's freedom in the most direct and daring of ways. Its members are dedicated to the organization with a passion reminiscent of a new religious movement or an underground political party. Zoya herself is now a RAWA activist, in the Pakistan refugee camp where she lives. Latifa was exiled from Afghanistan when a trip she had made abroad with her parents to testify against the Taliban regime was discovered. Tamim Ansary came to the United States with his mother and has made his life, as he describes it, between his two cultures. Afghanistan is in ruins and desperately in need of the skills of its displaced middle class. If none of these authors is on the point of return, it may be in part because reality in Afghanistan remains a long way from those happy images of Afghan women shedding their burkas that we enjoyed last November.","'S STORY An  Woman's Struggle for Freedom.

The stories told in the three books under review -- 's Story,"" ""My Forbidden Face"" and ""West of , East of "" -- illustrate many of the questions that the West needs to answer if  is to emerge from this latest round of warfare in a better state than before. A little reflection on the long battle over the bodies and souls of  women raises one question in particular: Was this a battle between secularism and Islam or between tradition and modernity? Two of these books are written by young women who lived under the  -- both using pseudonyms here -- the third by an -n man who became famous overnight for an e-mail message he sent to 20 friends in the wake of Sept. 11 that was rapidly copied and sent on until it reached, he estimates, hundreds of thousands of people. These feel like familiar stories -- examples of a well-established genre, even: the personal account that illustrates the wider political context. It does not diminish their particularity to say that they are illustrative rather than revelatory, reinforcing what we feel we understand rather than shedding new light or bringing new understanding. The 's treatment of women was well known before Sept. 11, not least because of the efforts of the  the Women of , known as , which figures large in ""'s Story."" 's account, written with the assistance of two journalists,  and , illuminates the clandestine resistance, first to the mujahedeen and then to the , that many intellectuals engaged in. Both her parents were active in clandestine politics -- her mother as a member of  and her father in an unnamed underground organization. But it was only when her parents disappeared that  came to understand the risks they had run. She was left with only a surrogate grandmother to take care of her, and with 's help, the two managed to escape from the 's . It's clear from all three accounts that the  were only the most recent oppressors of  women, whose suffering is in part the result of the conflict between modernity and tradition in which the West has, on occasion, been on the wrong side. More recently, both women and girls have suffered the fate of being the most vulnerable members of a society destroyed by more than 20 years of war. All three of these memoirs are written from exile, in which the vanished  of childhood takes on the cast of a lost idyll. In ""West of , East of ,"" Tamim 's account of growing up between his father's  world and his mother's , the author conjures up a lost  world of extended families who lived in the private interior of the courtyard -- closed against the outside but linked to other clan families by ties of blood and belonging. In the compound, he writes, everyone shared the same space and within its walls women lived freely. To go from one compound to another they were veiled and escorted. It was a traditional world, but one that was flexible enough to accommodate 's n mother and her exotic ways. ""The family took her in as the Permanent Guest, always to be honored, loved and cared for.  society settled on treating her as an exception to the rules of gender: she was considered neither female nor male, but n."" The  family were among the well-to-do urban middle class competing for education and government jobs at a time when the royal family -- in the person of , the  monarch, and his cousin , the prime minister -- were trying to modernize . In 1959,  had challenged 's religious leaders to show him the passage in the Koran that said women must be veiled. When they failed, he declared the veil un-Islamic. Shortly thereafter, the women of the royal family bared their faces in public. The progressive middle classes welcomed it. The mullahs and the rural traditionalists saw it as a breach of traditional values that had to be resisted at all costs. 's government did other things that stirred resistance in  and in neighboring . He deposed the king and declared a republic, turning to the  for assistance in modernizing . He tried to inaugurate coeducation -- 's school was one of the first to allow girls to study in the same room as boys -- and to create a modern Islamic society. Women in the cities could wear Western dress, go to the cinema, study at the university and practice their professions. In the rural areas, though, they kept to the compound and the veil. The Marxist government that followed  in 1979 decreed that girls should go to school and promoted the rights of  women. The urban professional classes supported modernization but opposed the Soviet occupation for reasons of patriotism. The mullahs and the tribesmen were clearer -- they opposed both the reforms and the Soviet occupation. They had already declared holy war on the government, fighting to regain control both of their country and their women. With the entry of the , they got the support of  and the . With the Soviet retreat in 1989, the holy warriors had won their country back, if only to fight over it themselves. The women were next. All three accounts agree that the chaos that followed the Soviet withdrawal, as the various factions slugged it out for power, was the worst of times. Women were raped and murdered by the warlords and their men. All  suffered through four years of brutality and chaos. When the  conquered , many greeted the news with relief. At least a measure of order would be restored. Savage though the 's treatment of women was, the mujahedeen had been as bad. In one of the most haunting passages of ""My Forbidden Face,""  describes the trauma of her brother, a student at , who witnessed what happened during the departure of Gulbuddin , at the time 's favored warlord and today still a menacing shadow over 's future. When 's men ceded the university campus to  of the  in 1992, among the souvenirs they abandoned was the naked body of a woman, bisected and nailed to either side of a pair of swinging doors. In that context, even public execution for adultery stands out a little less than it would in  or , though for  and her family  rule meant virtual house arrest. As is clear from her account (written with  and translated from the French by ), the three women of the household -- her mother, a retired doctor; her sister , a flight attendant; and , with her ambitions to be a journalist -- adjusted badly to this suddenly enforced purdah. ""This isn't clothing,""  writes of the first time she tried on a burka. ""It's a jail cell."" Her mother became depressed, her sister angry.  alternated between the two. Eventually, though, they resisted -- her mother by treating patients in secret,  by teaching girls in their home after the  had banned them from school. Revolutionary movements born in fire incline to the repressive, of course, but there was a hatred and fear of women in the  creed that went beyond even the revolutionary norm and differed from the brutalities of war. In his book "",""  observed that the  were largely a generation of refugees who grew up in an almost exclusively male society in the camps of northern . There, the world of extended family and life within the compound gates -- the world of women -- had been shattered. Or, as  puts it in his memoir: ""They had never tasted how it was. They knew nothing of the lost world except for scattered phrases they heard from their fathers and uncles, who came out of  rarely, and then on stretchers . . . choking out the words 'Son, always kill infidels; never let strangers see our women.' "" The word medieval was often used -- inappropriately -- to characterize the . They represented a third variant in the struggle for the  soul: they rejected the Western (and the Soviet) vision of progress, but they were enemies, too, of the mujahedeen and of traditional tribal authority. Their vision of the state was hardly sophisticated, but to the degree that it demanded loyalty to a centralizing ideology rather than to a clan elder, it was closer to a 20th-century formulation than traditional rural society had been. Perversely, the  became even more misogynist than the tribal leaders, perhaps precisely because they were free of tribal and family constraints. ,  and  all come from the kind of families that supported the trend toward modernization of  society that was interrupted in the late 1970's.

This secular, nonbelligerent middle class -- often left-wing -- could find no place under the mujahedeen or the . Some suffered internal exile, abandoning their professions in favor of raw survival. Others went abroad, where the fortunate made new lives while a few less favored were murdered, even outside , by fundamentalists who saw their ideas as a threat. One of the more famous such assassinations took the life of , the young poet who founded the  the Women of  in  in 1977 to fight for women's emancipation.

"NYT",1984,"Italy","BENETTON: FASHION'S MAVERICK","When it opens a new boutique, Benetton is usually satisfied with a modest appearance - a bright green facade, say, and wooden clothing shelves propped against the walls. The overall effect is, to say the least, unprepossessing, as befits the fashion equivalent of fast food. But several years ago, when Benetton sought to open a boutique along Zurich's meticulous Bahnhofstrasse, the avenue's store owners and bankers objected that the design was below-standard. Benetton adapted, overcoming the resistance with ingenious window displays and elegant furnishings, and now the shop is among Benetton's most profitable. The resolution of the run-in with Zurich's arbiters of taste demonstrates the elasticity that Benetton has applied in becoming Italy's fastest- growing fashion empire. In Upscale U.S. Market The question now is whether the company's prescription for success in Europe will work in the United States, where it has entered the fiercely competitive, upscale market for youthful women's clothing. ''Obviously, marketing will be extremely important because of the rapid turnover in trends,'' said Jay Fairfield, a retail trade analyst at Piper, Jaffray & Hopwood in Minneapolis. ''The ones that seem to have more difficulty are those catering to younger tastes, because of the fickleness of younger consumers. It's not so much a risk factor, but they'll probably have to work harder to maintain interest.'' In large measure, the company's success in Europe can be traced to the efficiency of its computerized inventory system, which, in linking its stores, provides immediate intelligence reports on shifts in what customers want, enabling the company to make immediate adjustments in production. Thus, much of Benetton's knitwear is produced in neutral gray so the company can quickly dye it in any of 60 hues according to changing customer demand. By any standard, the growth of Benetton, which has 2,600 shops, including 180 in North America, has been extraordinarily steady and free of problems. Revenue this year is expected to reach $330 million. Work Farmed Out The company's headquarters are the 17th-century Villa Minelli, with magnificently restored frescoes, in this provincial Venetian town. And it farms out much of its work to small suppliers, about 200 of them in nearby villages, whose nonunion wages and low overhead keep production costs low and offer insulation against labor troubles. Benetton's clothes are created on state-of-the-art, computer-aided design terminals, and woven on microprocessor-controlled looms. Its vital electronic inventory system, which tracks stock flows by connecting shops across Europe to a central computer, may soon be linked with Washington and Tokyo by satellite. Industry Maverick In a world rooted in the artisan tradition of Italian tailoring, and dominated by high-fashion designers like Gianni Versace and Ottavio Missoni, Benetton found success by becoming the industry maverick. It follows fashion rather than creating it, and manufactures the company's classic, colorful and affordable clothing on a mass industrial scale. ''We were never content with what we had achieved,'' Benetton's founder and chairman, Luciano Benetton, a relaxed, open man of 49, said recently. ''Without exaggerating, I'd say we tried to be pessimists, always to feel threatened. The idea was to become industrialists, specialists.'' The company was founded in 1966 by Mr. Benetton; his sister, Giuliana, now chief of design, and their brothers, Gilberto, now the financial officer, and Carlo, chief of production. Giuliana, 47, who had a gift for design, persuaded Luciano, then a clothing salesman, that she could design clothing if he could manufacture and sell it. The company opened its first shop in Belluno, in northern Italy, in 1968, and rapidly moved from cardigans, sweaters and other knitwear into denim jeans - just in time to catch the jeans explosion of the mid- 1970's - and on into cotton clothes and T-shirts. By 1973, when Benetton made its first move outside Italy, to Paris, there were 200 or so stores in Italy, and generally a new store was opening every day. But analysts say the real move came in 1978, when the wave of casual dress that had swept the United States leaped the Atlantic. The number of Benetton shops in Italy rose to about 1,500 and there was a large expansion in France, West Germany, Britain and other European countries. ''We were conscious of our limits,'' Mr. Benetton said. ''We developed one collection at a time: first there was wool; then came jeans, denim, the rest.'' Sharp Rise in Revenues From 1980 to 1983, revenues more than doubled, to $271 million. In 1984, Mr. Benetton said, he expects sales of $330 million. Net income in 1983 was $5.8 million, which will be equaled or surpassed this year, he said. The family has also invested in other companies, including a 50 percent stake in Fiorucci, the clothing manufacturer, and a controlling share in Calzaturificio di Varese, a shoe company. Estimates of annual revenues of all the family holdings run as high as $800 million. Benetton has stores in 26 countries, and one of its more recent markets is Japan, which the company views as the linchpin of a strategy to penetrate much of the Far East. In 1980 Benetton opened a store in New York, its first in the United States, and the growth of the American chain has been rapid. The company now has 180 stores in North America, including at least one in every state. This year, Mr. Benetton expects North America to account for up to 8 percent of total revenues. 'Different From Europe' ''It's a territory, I would not say difficult, but different from Europe,'' he said. ''Naturally, our results there have been uneven. The capacity to appreciate us varies in the Northeast or in the West.'' In Europe, Benetton relies largely on its tight network of shops, with their radiant green facades, for advertisement, investing only about 2 percent of its budget in direct advertising. To offset its thin coverage in the United States, however, Benetton is undertaking a $4 million campaign, designed by J. Walter Thompson. And the new stores will keep coming, the company maintains. What is Benetton's potential in the United States? ''Objectively, we don't think it will be like Europe,'' Mr. Benetton said. ''The percentages will be lower. But we have to be elastic. We cannot pretend that in any of our markets we are secure.''","When it opens a new boutique,  is usually satisfied with a modest appearance - a bright green facade, say, and wooden clothing shelves propped against the walls.

"NYT",2002,"Netherlands","Breast Cancer: Genes Are Tied To Death Rates","Researchers have found a genetic signature in breast tumors that seems to be a powerful predictor of whether the cancer will spread and kill or whether it can easily be cured by surgery, causing no further harm. The research involved relatively few patients, all relatively young, and its conclusions remain to be confirmed by further studies. But scientists said the genetic signature -- the activity of a collection of 70 genes -- appears to predict cancer mortality better than traditional measures like tumor size or stage or whether the cancer has spread to a woman's underarm lymph nodes. In the study, 5.5 percent of women whose cancers had a good genetic signature died within the next decade, as against 45 percent of those with bad genetic signatures. It will be at least several years before the work could change medical practice. But the findings, by researchers in Amsterdam, are raising questions about the nature of cancer, its treatment and the benefits of early detection. The current study did not address questions about how to treat tumors. Questions about what to do when cancers have bad genetic signatures will have to be dealt with in future studies. In the meantime, the results are challenging some long-held beliefs. Doctors and patients have assumed, for example, that small tumors are more treatable. The idea was that as tumors grow, they acquire mutations that enable them to spread throughout the body. But the study, and smaller studies that looked at genetic signatures of other cancers, indicate that tumor size may be beside the point. Most tumors, the studies indicate, appear to be potentially deadly or not from the very start. Doctors have also long assumed that after surgery, to be safe, they should treat virtually every breast cancer patient with chemotherapy, hormonal therapy or radiation, based on the belief that it is very difficult to differentiate women who will be helped by additional treatment from those who do not need it. The study indicates that it may soon be possible to make that distinction and that in the future, many women will be told that chemotherapy is not necessary. ""The hope and the expectation is that we will be able to identify subsets of patients who require less aggressive therapy, or perhaps no therapy at all,"" said Dr. Todd Golub, who directs cancer genomics research at the Whitehead/M.I.T. Center for Genome Research in Cambridge, Mass. The study, published today in The New England Journal of Medicine, had its origins a few years ago when the researchers, led by Dr. Rene Bernards, a professor of molecular carcinogenesis at the Netherlands Cancer Institute in Amsterdam, began searching thousands of genes from breast tumors. They were asking whether there was a pattern of gene activity that was associated with a good prognosis and another associated with a bad prognosis. The methodology for such searches was developed only recently, with gene chips. When material from tumors is washed over the chips, fragments of active genes stick to the chips. Using fluorescent dyes to show when they get a hit, researchers can see patterns and correlate them with a tumor's behavior. Their initial study led the researchers to focus on 70 genes that they identified in a small study. The study indicated that the genes' activity appeared to predict prognosis, but that needed confirmation. So they began the new study involving 295 consecutive patients at the Netherlands Cancer Institute. The women, aged 52 and younger when their cancers were diagnosed, had had standard treatments from 1984 to 1995. Doctors had stored tissue from the women's tumors. They knew which tumors had spread to the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis. They also knew whether a woman's cancer spread throughout her body or whether she remained cancer-free after her initial treatment. And they knew who had died of breast cancer within a decade of diagnosis. ""We asked whether the gene signature would be able to predict disease outcome in these patients,"" Dr. Bernards said. ""The answer is very clear. It is so powerful that it is better than any of the known criteria used today in deciding if patients need further therapy."" The women whose cancer cells indicated a good prognosis had an 85.2 percent chance of remaining free of cancer over the next decade and a 94.5 percent of surviving the decade. Those whose cancer cells indicated a poor prognosis had a 50.6 percent chance of remaining cancer-free and a 54.6 percent of surviving that time. Small tumors often had bad genetic signatures while large tumors often had good ones, throwing into question a common assumption about how cancers develop. It is often said that cancers start off unable to spread, but as they grow, they acquire this ability. ""That is based on a notion that tumors go through an evolution where they acquire more mutations as they grow bigger,"" Dr. Bernards said. ""It says that small tumors are inherently less aggressive and less malignant. But our gene expression profiling shows that that notion is too simplistic, at least for breast cancer."" That is not to say that a small and harmless cancer can never become deadly, he added, but rather that most deadly cancers are potentially life-threatening even when they are very small. Dr. Golub put it bluntly: ""The metastatic potential is hard-wired at the time of diagnosis."" He said a tumor's fate could be sealed from the time it is detected, no matter how small it is. Dr. Golub said: ""These genetic studies are suggesting that your probability of metastasis may be hard-wired, but that is different from saying metastasis has already occurred. There still may be some importance to early detection."" Dr. Larry Norton, a breast cancer expert at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, said he believed ""the evidence really favors early diagnosis."" But, he said, ""even in the best cases -- small tumors, no positive nodes -- tumors can metastasize."" So, he said, if genetic signatures can identify tumors that are dangerous, though small, ""that could be a major advance."" Dr. Bernards said his study did not address what would have happened if the women had not all been treated, nor what were the best treatments. His study asked whether a tumor's genetic signature could predict how a woman would fare in a real-world situation where different doctors prescribed treatment. ""A separate question, that is not answered here but that certainly can be answered,"" he said, ""is how should a patient you identify as high risk be treated? Which cocktail of chemicals is most likely to yield responses?"" The advance, for cancers in general, will be substantial, Dr. Golub predicted. ""The way we do it now is to give everyone the same treatment, knowing that not everyone will respond. For those who don't respond, we say, 'O.K., let's go to plan B,' but by then they often are sicker, their tumors have progressed, and they have side effects of their initial treatment."" With genetic signatures, he said, ""you would give a therapy to those most likely to be cured and go directly to an alternative therapy for those who aren't."" Researchers say the next few years will be crucial. More studies are looking at genetic signatures of tumor cells. ""There is a tsunami of data"" that will appear soon in medical journals, said Dr. Marc Lippman, a breast cancer expert who heads the department of medicine at the University of Michigan School of Medicine. All the studies, researchers say, need to be followed by large prospective clinical trials. As a continuation of Dr. Bernards's study, Dr. Daniel Haber and colleagues at Harvard Medical School will begin a study of 500 women, with financing from Avon. They will send tumor tissue to Dr. Bernards at the time of diagnosis and follow the women to see if the genetic signatures predict the tumor's behavior. Dr. Haber said he hoped to expand the study to other medical centers. Most researchers were confident that a marked change in cancer diagnosis and treatment was inevitable. Genetic signatures, Dr. Lippman said, ""is a technology that is going to transform practice in the next handful of years."" The new study, he added, shows the potential. ""This is exciting. It's good news.""","Researchers have found a genetic signature in breast tumors that seems to be a powerful predictor of whether the cancer will spread and kill or whether it can easily be cured by surgery, causing no further harm.

So, he said, if genetic signatures can identify tumors that are dangerous, though small, ""that could be a major advance."" Dr.  said his study did not address what would have happened if the women had not all been treated, nor what were the best treatments. His study asked whether a tumor's genetic signature could predict how a woman would fare in a real-world situation where different doctors prescribed treatment. ""A separate question, that is not answered here but that certainly can be answered,"" he said, ""is how should a patient you identify as high risk be treated? Which cocktail of chemicals is most likely to yield responses?"" The advance, for cancers in general, will be substantial, Dr.  predicted. ""The way we do it now is to give everyone the same treatment, knowing that not everyone will respond. For those who don't respond, we say, 'O.K., let's go to plan B,' but by then they often are sicker, their tumors have progressed, and they have side effects of their initial treatment."" With genetic signatures, he said, ""you would give a therapy to those most likely to be cured and go directly to an alternative therapy for those who aren't."" Researchers say the next few years will be crucial. More studies are looking at genetic signatures of tumor cells. ""There is a tsunami of data"" that will appear soon in medical journals, said Dr. Marc , a breast cancer expert who heads the department of medicine at the . All the studies, researchers say, need to be followed by large prospective clinical trials. As a continuation of Dr. 's study, Dr. Daniel  and colleagues at  will begin a study of 500 women, with financing from . They will send tumor tissue to Dr.  at the time of diagnosis and follow the women to see if the genetic signatures predict the tumor's behavior. Dr.  said he hoped to expand the study to other medical centers. Most researchers were confident that a marked change in cancer diagnosis and treatment was inevitable. Genetic signatures, Dr.  said, ""is a technology that is going to transform practice in the next handful of years."" The new study, he added, shows the potential. ""This is exciting. It's good news."""

Weigkricht decided to attempt to talk her opponents out of a spade fit with a psychic response in that suit, and was horrified to hear her partner bid four diamonds. She was now tied to the track with the train approaching, for this was a splinter bid announcing diamond shortage and a desire to play a spade slam. Her partner's next bid was liable to be six spades, which the opponents would surely double. The alternative was to pass four diamonds, an equally unattractive choice. But as always happens with Pauline, or Terry, disaster was averted. West obliged by doubling four diamonds, and she was able to pass.

"NYT",1984,"United Kingdom","BRITISH FASHION RISES AND SHINES","The British fashion scene, coming alive after a sleep since the 1960's, is drawing increasing numbers to check out the shops, the street people, the experimental designers and the established houses. It turns out also that in Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher the British fashion industry has the best spokesman imaginable. The royal family is also doing its bit to promote fashion. Today the Princess of Wales, wearing a fuchsia suede suit, toured the Olympia exhibition hall, where 200 manufacturers have booths showing their fall collections. She spent at least 15 minutes at Jasper Conran's stand. The Prime Minister had taken time off from preparations for the European Economic Community's summit meeting in Brussels, which started today, to observe British Fashion Week with a reception Saturday at her official residence, 10 Downing Street. She was knowledgeable, forthright and approachable, according to the dozen or so representatives of United States concerns who received invitations to what proved to be the hottest ticket in town. The opportunity to visit 10 Downing Street drew such top executives as Melvin Jacobs, chairman of Saks Fifth Avenue; William S. Ruben, president of Bonwit Teller, and representatives of B. Altman's, Neiman- Marcus, Sakowitz and other stores that have traded in British fashions during the lean years. The guest list, limited to 200, included representatives of the British fashion industry as well as retailers and members of the press from around the world. As the guests were announced to Mrs. Thatcher, who stood alone to receive them, she had a personal word for everyone, including Katharine Hamnett, the designer who specializes in T-shirts bearing such messages as ''Stop Acid Rain'' and ''Stop Killing Whales.'' The one the designer wore to the reception read, ''58% Don't Want Pershing,'' referring to the American missiles being stationed in Europe, an action supported by Mrs. Thatcher, who said: ''You're probably quite right but we can't always have what we want. Sometimes we have to have what's good for us.'' Other British designers were more conventionally dressed. Zandra Rhodes wore a jeweled calf-length dress in gray chiffon that looked attractive with her pink hair. Elizabeth Emanuel, who with her husband, David, designed the wedding dress of the Princess of Wales, wore black sequined knickers. Valerie Louthan had on a mauve velvet dinner suit. Mrs. Thatcher appeared in a black velvet dinner suit with a short jacket and a full skirt banded at the hem with black silk and extending into a brief train. Everyone always steps on the train, she said. She told the first few people who inquired that the suit was homemade, but she later explained that she had ordered it a few years back from her dressmaker, Maureen Baker, to wear to the Lord Mayor's banquet. It has been altered three times. Sometimes 'Wonderful Colors' The Prime Minister acknowledged that clothes were important to her because ''unless you know you're dressed right, you're uncomfortable.'' She said that for ''executive women like me clothes must never be flamboyant.'' She wears a lot of black and white but now and then, she said, she breaks out in ''the most wonderful colors.'' The greatest current fashion development, she said, is that ''you can wear clothes whatever length you want.'' She does not change her hemlines from year to year, she added. The divergence in London between experimental and traditional clothes is very much in evidence. Along King's Road young people of both sexes, wearing leather jackets and crested Mohawk haircuts, look for fluorescent orange or chartreuse gloves, anklets and head wrappings in trendy shops such as the Liberated Lady or Boy, where a salesman named Terry, wearing a black dress, is a tourist attraction. The 26 fashion showings scheduled for the four days ending today included representatives of both avant- garde and traditional aspects of British fashion. Antony Price, who repeated his show three evenings at the Hippodrome, a Piccadilly nightclub, sold tickets for about $18 and filled the house each time. He presented some slouchy tweed jackets with baggy pants and long tube dresses before moving into novelties such as Viennese shirred-lampshade dresses worn with Carmen Miranda headdresses. Some of the zaniness of the young crowd has moved into the establishment houses. Zandra Rhodes, for instance, has adapted the Mohawk hair style for the mannequins showing her beautifully beaded chiffon evening dresses. She added earrings with batteries and fluorescent pink lipstick. She and Jean Muir, both graduates of the 60's and both at the top of their form this season, have become British classics. Miss Rhodes's styles are flamboyantly feminine while Miss Muir's are elegantly controlled. At the Muir show Lady Antonia Fraser and Lady Henderson, wife of the former Ambassador to Washington, compared notes on the navy-blue dresses, four and six years old, that they were wearing. Miss Muir used a great many traditional British woolens in coats and jackets that were much softer and more feminine than similar styles shown in Milan last week. Her leathers, including a black jacket that wrapped across the front and a brown suit with a full skirt, looked gentle, not tough. Her black silk jersey dresses, a trademark, were the most beautiful she has done, according to Geraldine Stutz, president of Henri Bendel. Sheridan Barnett, whose sportswear look combines British tailoring with American flair, showed culottes, reefer coats and no-nonsense spectator dresses, all in the near-ankle length that is dominant amid the variations. He is one of the designers whose clothes get better each season. British fashion is a study in contradictions, so every action seems to have an equal and opposite reaction. Arabella Pollen, the friend of the Princess of Wales who opened her own dressmaking business a year ago, presented two lengths, one above the knee, the other just below. The Emanuels, who offered demure bouffant dresses six months ago, are doing clingy, draped dresses with rhinestones. Some are in black leather. ''It's the result of two trips to the United States,'' said Mrs. Emanuel, explaining the change. ''We saw all that glitz in New York and decided we had to be sharper.'' Small Waistlines, Full Skirts Caroline Charles, whose clothes are worn by Princess Anne as well as her sister-in-law, makes day and evening clothes with small waistlines and full skirts. Roland Klein used woolens patterned in black and brown squares for coats and jackets that were both sober and arresting, and Mr. Conran picked the same fabric for coats to go over his brown leather jackets. John Bates and a number of other designers showed short jersey chemises with leather inserts and appliques that were reminiscent of the 60's. Yuki, the resident Japanese designer for 20 years, draped jersey dresses in interesting ways. Most of the designers made a special effort because, as Miss Muir observed, ''There is such a good feeling here at the moment I didn't want to let London down.''

"WP",1991,"France","Brits Boil Over French Kiss-Off; In Old Interview, New Prime Minister Says Anglo-Saxons Not Interested in Women","The Gaul of her! Edith Cresson, France's first woman prime minister, appears to have taken the famed French cultural chauvinism a bit too far, touching off a minor international incident in the process. In an interview published in Britain this week, she reportedly declared that French men are more interested in women than are men in England or Germany or the United States -- where a quarter of them, she said, ""are homosexual."" The published quotes -- based on a four-year-old interview that she says she does not recall -- may have done much to repair her relations with French men, some of whom greeted her appointment last month with a certain degree of hostility and suspicion. But it has done nothing for her relationship with certain European Community colleagues. The British tabloids frothed. ""It's not for nothing they call it Gay Paree,"" wrote one. The Sun sniffed that it was a bit much coming from the leader of a country where men carry handbags and kiss each other on both cheeks. The Daily Telegraph, adopting a stiffer upper lip, declared that Cresson's remarks were not fair and noted that Prime Minister John Major would be thrown out of office if he characterized French women in a similar manner. In the House of Commons, conservative deputy Tony Marlow said, ""Mrs. Cresson has sought to insult the virility of the British male because the last time she was in London she did not get enough admiring glances."" Marlow was ruled out of order when he tried to pass a resolution saying: ""This House does not fancy elderly French women."" Cresson is 57. The article published last week in the British newspaper the Observer was based on a 1987 interview with Cresson, the newspaper said; at the time, she was a private citizen, between jobs as French minister of external trade and minister of European affairs. Asked if she believed it was true that in Anglo-Saxon countries men preferred the company of other men, Cresson was quoted as responding, ""Yes, but the majority of these men are homosexual -- perhaps not the majority -- but in the United States there are already 25 percent of them and in England and in Germany it is much the same. You cannot imagine it in the history of France."" (Most studies suggest that in any culture -- in any country -- roughly 10 percent of the men are homosexual.) In the interview, Cresson reportedly went on to say that Anglo-Saxons are just not interested in women, and that that shortcoming probably merits psychoanalysis. She recalled noticing on walks through London how men don't bother to look at women, in contrast to the situation in Paris. ""I don't know if it is cultural or biological, but there is something there that does not work, that's for sure. ... A man who is not interested in women is, in some ways, a little handicapped."" Cresson said yesterday that she could not recall meeting or holding a conversation with the author, Naim Attallah.  Pressed about the subject, she acknowledged to a French radio station that she believed ""English men surely are more reserved toward women than French men, but in the end, each country has its own traditions and culture."" ""I like England very much in a general way, and I have nothing more to say about this so-called interview that came out of a drawer,"" she said, deploring what she called the absence of ""fair play"" by the author. Attallah told the Reuter news agency that he obtained the interview, conducted in French, while researching a book on women. ""I have the tape, the date, the hour and the place,"" he said. Donald Trelford, the Observer's editor, said, ""We are completely confident that it is authentic."" The latest brouhaha involving Cresson's brash opinions, barely a month after she took office with a blistering attack on the Japanese threat to dominate the world economy, was greeted with smug satisfaction in France. In the purported interview with Attallah, Cresson also aired views -- decidedly French views -- on the subject of extramarital affairs. ""In France, it is seen as all right if a man -- even a public man -- has affairs, casual flings. In America, I know he must not, but here. ... I think we order things better here. That sort of thing is part of ordinary life, and no one attaches much importance to it. On the contrary, it's considered almost to the credit of the person concerned. For myself, I see nothing unseemly about it -- rather amusing, in fact."" Cresson's appointment as prime minister was assailed by some members of the conservative opposition as the byproduct of an alleged romantic liaison with President Francois Mitterrand. She has often lamented the plight of women politicians who must cope with rumors that they achieve power only by sleeping with powerful men. But she has also refused to be cowed by such innuendo into renouncing her own sexuality and her avowed affection for men. ""I believe that women have exactly the same sexual appetites as men do -- there is no difference, and women also can have passing affairs in the same way as men,"" she reportedly told Attallah. ""I do not think that in either case it is a fit subject for jokes, something to be laughed at. It is simply a biological fact.""","The Gaul of her!

"WP",2001,"Afghanistan","Buddhas' Rubble Marks a Turn for Taliban","Ten days after Afghanistan's ruling Taliban movement began blasting two historic Buddha statues to rubble despite protests from around the world, Taliban authorities today slaughtered 100 cows and distributed their meat to the poor in an Islamic ritual of atonement. But the animal sacrifice was not a gesture of repentance over the demise of the majestic, 1,500-year-old monuments. Instead, the Taliban, the radical Islamic group that controls most of Afghanistan, said it was meant to seek Allah's forgiveness for having taken several days more than expected to destroy them. Officials said the massive stone Buddhas, carved from steep cliffs, resisted initial military attacks and were finally blown up with dynamite. The destruction of the statues, and the haste to demolish them once a religious edict was announced, vividly illustrate how far the Taliban movement has retreated from the modern world during the past year, and how determined Taliban leaders are to create what they view as a pure Islamic society that answers only to the rigid dictates of God. ""The decision on the Buddhas was made according to Islamic rules. It was not done to insult any particular religion, but once an Islamic order is made it cannot be changed,"" said Quadratullah Jamal, the Taliban's information minister. The event also appears to mark a turning point within the Taliban. Following an internal struggle, some foreign observers here said, Islamic hard-liners have gained influence over moderates who support collaboration with international agencies on a variety of issues, from historic preservation to women's rights. In recent months, ""Taliban ideology has become more conservative and narrow-minded,"" said one source, a professional with an international agency here. ""They have done this to show they are the purists, the real face of Islam."" Just two years ago, Mohammed Omar, the Taliban's top leader, ordered that Afghanistan's heritage should be preserved and that the Buddhas of Bamian, a province in central Afghanistan, should be viewed with ""respect"" and as a potential source of tourism. But on Feb. 26, Omar issued an order that they should be smashed as ""shrines of infidels,"" along with all other non-Islamic statues. On women's rights, another major area of international concern, the Taliban also made an abrupt policy change. Although the movement always banned women from work and school, it initially permitted them to participate in projects run by foreign charities, which sustained thousands of war widows. But last summer, Omar issued a decree barring Afghan women from working with foreign agencies. Some foreign observers here say these radical shifts stem partly from the Taliban's growing sense of isolation and frustration after the U.N. Security Council imposed economic sanctions to punish the Taliban for alleged links with Islamic terrorism -- particularly for harboring Osama bin Laden, the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the bombings of two U.S. embassies and a U.S. Navy warship. In 1999 the United Nations froze Taliban assets abroad and grounded the Afghan national airline; last December it banned foreign military aid to the Taliban and most international travel by its officials. At a time when Afghanistan's impoverished people are struggling to survive drought, hunger and civil war, observers say, its rulers are lashing back at a world they see as dominated by callous infidels -- even though the United Nations and other agencies have poured millions of dollars into Afghan relief and refugee aid programs. ""I don't think the Taliban grasped the seriousness of the first sanctions, but the second set hit them strongly,"" one international aid official said. ""Now they feel the world has pushed them into a corner, so they are telling the world, 'This is our place, we can do what we want, and we don't care what you think.' "" Although Taliban authorities insist they destroyed the Buddhas for religious reasons, they also express pained indignation at the sanctions, amazement at the world's outraged reaction to the Buddha controversy and dismay that the West has failed to applaud them for banning the cultivation of opium poppies, used to produce heroin. ""The international agencies didn't help us when they had a golden opportunity on banning drugs,"" said Wakil Ahmad Muttawakil, the Taliban foreign minister. ""The world did not help us when hundreds of Afghan people died from cold. But when some stones were destroyed, there was a hue and cry from the world which astonished us."" In interviews this week, several Muslim clerics and members of the Taliban militia seemed indifferent to their country's increasing isolation. Some even welcomed it as a sign that Afghanistan is on the right religious track. ""We sacrificed 200,000 lives to install an Islamic government. Now that we have destroyed the idols, we hope it will bring the blessings of God on us,"" said Maulvi Shujauddin Haddam, leader of a large Kabul mosque. ""We don't have to follow any other kind of Islam. The real Islam is only in Afghanistan now. The farther the international community gets from us, the more we are convinced of the truth of our religion."" For many Afghan Muslims, however, the demolition of the Buddhas has come as a sad, bewildering blow to their national pride and sense of place in history. On Chicken Street in Kabul, a lane of antique dealers, merchants lamented the loss of the Buddhas as well as thousands of historic relics and sites that were damaged and looted during the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s and factional fighting in the early 1990s. ""Everything of historical value has either been carried out of the country or broken,"" said one dealer, fingering a small bronze mirror from Afghanistan's Buddhist era. ""We claim to have a 5,000-year history,"" he said. ""These statues and artifacts are the evidence of that. If all the evidence is gone, how will we prove our claim?"" An elderly man named Sayeed, who said he once worked as a tour guide in Bamian, called the Buddhas ""a miracle of world religion that showed Afghanistan was on the highway of civilization."" In recent years, he said, ""so much was damaged by war or stolen by outsiders, but now our own government is destroying our heritage."" Taliban authorities have not allowed journalists to visit Bamian. Last week the Taliban expelled a BBC correspondent for reporting that some Afghans disapproved of the demolition, and police detained six journalists for trying to photograph the Kabul Museum, which has been sealed shut. Officials are especially touchy about reports that early last month they destroyed more than 50 pre-Islamic artifacts in the museum, including a famous seated Buddha. They insist that the statues were smashed only after the Feb. 26 order from Omar, following a period of research and advice from religious scholars. But diplomats and preservationists said the campaign to destroy the Buddhas and other ""idols"" began last year, when the museum opened briefly. Some conservative Muslim clerics were reportedly offended at the displays and slapped some of the statues. The museum was quickly closed again, and one official who had worked with foreign preservationists was transferred. Last month a group of diplomats who had helped finance the restoration of Afghan antiquities visited Kabul to express their concern for the Buddhas' safety. They said Muttawakil, the foreign minister, reassured them the statues would be preserved, but within hours the Taliban radio station broadcast the edict ordering all idols destroyed, including the Bamian monuments. ""We were totally shocked,"" said one member of the delegation. ""We had been thrilled with Mullah Omar's earlier edict on protecting the statues, and we had spent a lot of money to help them preserve their heritage. So this came as a terrible blow."" Some analysts here and in Pakistan suggested the Buddhas' destruction was also aimed at punishing the inhabitants of Bamian, most of whom are Shiite Muslims from the Hazara ethnic group and many of whom support armed opposition groups still fighting against Taliban rule. The Taliban movement, led by radical Sunni Muslims, regards Shiites as infidels. Other observers said they suspected authorities were trying to cover up widespread smuggling of valuable pre-Islamic artifacts out of the country, many of which have reportedly turned up in markets in Pakistan. But Taliban officials said they have worked hard to crack down on smuggling and intend to preserve all historical objects that fit within Islamic rules. ""When we came to power, we said we would safeguard historic relics,"" said Jamal, the information minister. ""We banned illegal excavations, we started repairing monuments and we collected artifacts."" By imposing sanctions, he charged, ""the world wants to terminate the history of Afghanistan. But Afghanistan has a long and rich history. We cannot finish it by destroying two statues.""","Ten days after 's ruling  movement began blasting two historic  statues to rubble despite protests from around the world,  authorities today slaughtered 100 cows and distributed their meat to the poor in an Islamic ritual of atonement. But the animal sacrifice was not a gesture of repentance over the demise of the majestic, 1,500-year-old monuments. Instead, the , the radical Islamic group that controls most of , said it was meant to seek Allah's forgiveness for having taken several days more than expected to destroy them. Officials said the massive stone s, carved from steep cliffs, resisted initial military attacks and were finally blown up with dynamite. The destruction of the statues, and the haste to demolish them once a religious edict was announced, vividly illustrate how far the  movement has retreated from the modern world during the past year, and how determined  leaders are to create what they view as a pure Islamic society that answers only to the rigid dictates of God. ""The decision on the s was made according to Islamic rules. It was not done to insult any particular religion, but once an Islamic order is made it cannot be changed,"" said , the 's information minister. The event also appears to mark a turning point within the . Following an internal struggle, some foreign observers here said, Islamic hard-liners have gained influence over moderates who support collaboration with international agencies on a variety of issues, from historic preservation to women's rights. In recent months, "" ideology has become more conservative and narrow-minded,"" said one source, a professional with an international agency here. ""They have done this to show they are the purists, the real face of Islam."" Just two years ago, , the 's top leader, ordered that 's heritage should be preserved and that the s of , a province in central , should be viewed with ""respect"" and as a potential source of tourism. But on Feb. 26,  issued an order that they should be smashed as ""shrines of infidels,"" along with all other non-Islamic statues. On women's rights, another major area of international concern, the  also made an abrupt policy change. Although the movement always banned women from work and school, it initially permitted them to participate in projects run by foreign charities, which sustained thousands of war widows. But last summer,  issued a decree barring  women from working with foreign agencies. Some foreign observers here say these radical shifts stem partly from the 's growing sense of isolation and frustration after the  imposed economic sanctions to punish the  for alleged links with Islamic terrorism -- particularly for harboring , the Saudi dissident accused of masterminding the bombings of two  embassies and a  warship. In 1999 the  froze  assets abroad and grounded the  national airline; last December it banned foreign military aid to the  and most international travel by its officials. At a time when 's impoverished people are struggling to survive drought, hunger and civil war, observers say, its rulers are lashing back at a world they see as dominated by callous infidels -- even though the  and other agencies have poured millions of dollars into  relief and refugee aid programs. ""I don't think the  grasped the seriousness of the first sanctions, but the second set hit them strongly,"" one international aid official said. ""Now they feel the world has pushed them into a corner, so they are telling the world, 'This is our place, we can do what we want, and we don't care what you think.' "" Although  authorities insist they destroyed the s for religious reasons, they also express pained indignation at the sanctions, amazement at the world's outraged reaction to the  controversy and dismay that the West has failed to applaud them for banning the cultivation of opium poppies, used to produce heroin. ""The international agencies didn't help us when they had a golden opportunity on banning drugs,"" said , the  foreign minister. ""The world did not help us when hundreds of  people died from cold.

"NYT",2013,"Canada","Canadian Women's Team Loses Its Edge Before Sochi","GRAND FORKS, N.D. -- Late in his second practice with Canada's women's hockey team Thursday, Coach Kevin Dineen gathered his players inside the blue line and introduced a contest. The forward lines, the defensemen and the goalies nominated someone from each group to shoot at the opposite goal. First group to miss had to skate a lap. Hard. The point? Nothing more than a tension release. It was one week after Dan Church had stunned the team by resigning as coach less than two months before the Olympics, a development neither he nor Hockey Canada, the sport's national governing body, has fully explained. Dineen, a former N.H.L. player and coach, sensed that his players, after a stressful week, could use a smile. Hence, the contest. Each group found the net until goaltender Geneviève Lacasse fired wide, sending three chagrined goalies down the ice while their teammates laughed and howled. Dineen's debut behind the Canada bench at Ralph Engelstad Arena on Friday did not go as well. Canada lost to the United States for the second time since Church resigned, and the game ended with a melee. Ten fighting majors were issued, and six players from each team occupied the penalty box at the final horn. The game, which ended 4-1, was not the first time these neighbors and rivals had mixed it up; a fight broke out during an October game after Jocelyne Lamoureux of the United States ran into Canada's goalie Shannon Szabados. Although the players remain puzzled by Church's departure, they embraced Dineen, who brought instant credibility and calm to a reeling team. ''I think it was a challenging week for us, probably more so than we realized it was going to be,'' said Jayna Hefford, a four-time Olympian and three-time gold medalist. ''You have someone with you that's been with you for so long, invested so much in this process, was so passionate about what they're doing. ''When Dan left, it was a shock to all of us. There wasn't a lot of closure there. After a few days, once they named Kevin as a new coach, for our team that was a chance to move forward. Now we're excited. We're looking towards Sochi. We're looking towards building over the next six weeks to being there.'' Church was coaching at York University in Toronto when Hockey Canada entrusted him with the Olympic team, two months after he directed Canada to the 2012 world championship. It is not a job for the timid. Canada had won the last three Olympic tournaments after finishing second to the United States in 1998. The position comes with the understanding that any medal besides gold is a catastrophe. ''I don't miss it,'' said Melody Davidson, Canada's coach through the previous two Olympics cycles before stepping down to become general manager. Troublesome signs emerged as early as January, when Church's father, David, died of liver cancer at 70. It shook Church, but he continued. Canada lost to the Americans, 3-2, in the world championship final in April but bounced back to win the Four Nations Cup in November and sweep the first three games of the six-game United States-Canada series that usually precedes the Olympics. Canada traditionally plays up to 30 games against Midget AAA boys' teams as part of its Olympic preparation. Worn down by injuries and too many road games, Canada struggled in the series, going 12-14 and losing 6 of 7 in November. That was the month Church cut defenseman Tessa Bonhomme, a veteran of the 2010 Games and four world championship tournaments, and forward Jenelle Kohanchuk, 23, who scored twice against Finland in the Four Nations title game. ''We were very tired at that point in the season,'' said Caroline Ouellette, the team captain, who is a three-time gold medalist. ''Things were not going so well. But in an amateur sport, you rarely see a coaching change. We didn't expect it. I think that was the most difficult thing, the shock of having to react and manage that, because we're not used to that like the N.H.L. players are.'' Church resigned Dec. 12, hours before Canada lost to the United States, 5-1, in Calgary, Alberta, with the assistant coaches Danielle Goyette and Lisa Haley filling in. Several players said they never saw it coming. On Dec. 10, Church wrote on Twitter that he was looking forward to seeing the former York player Kaylee Black, a high school coach in Moorhead, Minn., at Friday's game. Church told The Toronto Globe and Mail that he was not forced out. ''It came down to a confidence issue -- and if you don't have the confidence of certain people, it's probably time to move on,'' he said in the interview, without identifying anyone. Davidson offered an equally murky explanation. ''In the end, Dan was presented a lot of different decisions and made a decision to leave,'' she said Friday. ''We moved forward from there.'' Asked what those decisions entailed, Davidson said: ''Normal team things: what direction you want to go, what do you want to do, how do you want to use players? There was a lot of discussion around all of that.'' Ouellette said: ''It was really a stressful time. We didn't know who was going to step in and be our coach.'' The players kicked around names but none thought of Dineen, who was fired by the Florida Panthers in November. Dineen, a former center, played in the 1984 Olympics for Canada and went on to score 355 goals in 19 N.H.L. seasons before turning to coaching. He landed the Florida job in 2011 after six seasons with Portland in the American Hockey League. Looking for work, Dineen called Bob Nicholson, Hockey Canada's president, a few days before Church quit, offering to coach the 2014 men's world championship team. Nicholson put Dineen off. When Church left, Nicholson thought of Dineen, whose only experience coaching women came with his teenage daughter Hannah's select team in Maine several years earlier. (Hannah is now a freshman hockey player at Colby College.) ''I'm a product of Hockey Canada,'' said Dineen, whose father, Bill, coached in the World Hockey Association and the N.H.L. ''I've always felt very strongly about that maple leaf. To be able to wear that on the front of the jersey, there can't be anything more special than that.'' Last Tuesday, his first day on the job, the players tried to be helpful by taping their names to their helmets at practice. At the team Christmas party that night, to test him, several players suggested that he distribute the presents. ''He got a little bit nervous because he realized he wasn't going to be very good at giving out the gifts,'' Hefford said. ''We made him do the assistant coaches, which he got 100 percent on.'' Dineen must now make final cuts and tighten a lineup that has been outscored in its last two games against the United States by 9-2. Missing from those games because of injury were Hayley Wickenheiser, a four-time Olympian, and Marie-Philip Poulin, who scored both goals in Canada's 2-0 victory over the United States in the 2010 Olympic final. The teams meet twice more before Sochi, Saturday in St. Paul and Dec. 30 in Toronto. ''We have some skill out there,'' Dineen said. ''It's a team that was up and down. I'm looking for some more consistency out of this group. There are some areas that we can address and kind of get more in sync than we are right now.'' Most of all, he must soothe concerns and find solutions. With a gold medal at stake, smiles at practice go only so far.","GRAND FORKS,  -- Late in his second practice with 's women's hockey team Thursday, Coach   gathered his players inside the blue line and introduced a contest.

"NYT",1990,"Saudi Arabia","CONFRONTATION IN THE GULF; Saudis Widen Military Recruiting And Encourage Women to Work","In his edict on women in the workplace, the official Saudi press agency said that the King ordered ''all specialized Government authorities to accept those women volunteers who present themselves to carry on duties in the areas of human services and medical services within the context of fully preserving Islamic and social values.'' Several Saudis said the shift was striking since it came from the highest authority in this conservative Muslim society, not from the liberal fringe which has for years pressed for a greater role for women. Limits on Jobs for Women In traditional Islamic societies, public contact between the sexes is virtually nonexistent. Women are free to take jobs serving other women, for example as gynecologists or as teachers in girls' schools in the gender-segregated educational system. But because Islamic tradition strongly promotes the notion that a woman's place is in the home, the vast majority of Saudi women have not made their presence felt in the labor market. Many of the jobs now available to women in Saudi Arabia are filled by foreigners. The immediate impact of the royal edict will be to encourage Saudi women to take these jobs. But over time it could lead to the employment of Saudi women in jobs that would put them in public contact with men, such as nursing in men's wards in hospitals or working as clerks in banks and stores with male clienteles. The directive would free more men for military service, but its principal aim appears to be to reduce the country's dependence on foreign workers. The King's directives are the most palpable evidence of a remarkable change underway in this country since the invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. In the first few days following the invasion, the Saudi Government and press virtually ignored the event. But when Iraqi troops began massing near the Saudi-Kuwaiti border and King Fahd decided to invite foreign forces to participate in Saudi Arabia's defense, Saudi officials and commentators appeared to abandon a tradition of discreet and timid diplomacy in favor of an increasingly militant resolve to challenge Iraq. ''What is happening in the face of this crisis is that both the Saudi leadership and people are rising up to the challenge posed by Iraq,'' said Khaled al-Maeena, editor of The Arab News, a daily newspaper published in Jidda. ''There is a silver lining in this cloud over us - the rise of social consciousness and activism. The crisis is making us all aware that we have to depend primarily on ourselves.'' A Nation Energized Rabaa al-Khatib, a professor of English literature at King Abelaziz Univerity here, said in a telephone interview that the crisis ''is stirring things in a way many of us never dreamed could happen.'' ''After what we saw happening in Kuwait,'' she continued, ''all the women employees on my staff have asked for first aid and civil defense training, if only to protect ourselves.'' Saudi Arabia is also getting tougher in its foreign policy, abandoning its penchant for discreet diplomacy in its evolving alliances with Egypt, Morocco and perhaps Syria against Iraq, Jordan, Yemen and the Palestine Liberation Organization. Saudi pressure, with support from Egypt and Syria, stood behind the resignation on Monday of the secretary general of the Arab League, Chedli Klibi. Mr. Klibi had failed to condemn the Iraqi invasion, and Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi Foreign Minister, bitterly and publicly criticized Mr. Klibi for his handling of the crisis two days ago in Cairo, provoking his resignation. In other signs of their displeasure, Saudi officials said they have rejected a call from Jordan for additional supplies of oil and have ''discouraged in the strongest terms'' a request by the P.L.O. chairman, Yasir Arafat, to visit the kingdom. King Fahd publicly received Hani al-Hassan, a senior P.L.O. official, but Saudi officials described the meeting as ''pointless.'' ''Hani al-Hassan talked for two hours without explaining in a satisfactory way the reasons why the P.L.O. and Arafat support Iraq,'' one senior Saudi official said. Saudi officials are said to have bluntly informed Mr. Hassan they find his explanations ''insufficient and insincere.'' Similarly, the Saudis have taken a tough stand toward the Jordanian monarch, King Hussein, whose policy of trying to mediate between Iraq and the Gulf countries was described here as ''an aimless exercise of turning in circles.'' The Saudis said they refuse to consider any mediation attempts by the Jordanian King in the crisis as long as he does not agree to the principle of an unconditional withdrawal by Iraq from Kuwait and the restoration of the ruling Sabah family. These Saudi official views parallel a public mood of antipathy toward all those in the Arab world who have given tacit or open support to Iraq. Saudi newspapers are publishing hundreds of letters to the editor every day and random interviews reflect the depth of the Saudi public's anger at what happened in Kuwait. It is reinforced by daily reports of atrocities committed against Kuwaiti civilians by the occupying Iraqi troops. ''All those who stood with the Kuwait's invasion and supported it in words and deeds, openly or covertly, have committed suicide in a moral and spiritual way,'' wrote Ghazi al-Gossaibi, the Saudi Ambassador to Bahrain, said in an editorial published here today in the daily Asharq Al Awsat. According to Saudi officials, the increased assertiveness in external and internal policies by the Saudi Government is guided by a conviction that a military confrontation with Iraq will eventually occur and that both the Saudi Government and the Saudi population must be prepared for it. ''The bottom line is that the entire Saudi leadership, from the King on down, is convinced that we cannot live with Saddam Hussein anymore. He has got to go,'' a Saudi official said.''Unless Iraq withdraws from Kuwait voluntarily it, will have to be forced to do so.''","In his edict on women in the workplace, the official  press agency said that the King ordered ''all specialized Government authorities to accept those women volunteers who present themselves to carry on duties in the areas of human services and medical services within the context of fully preserving Islamic and social values.''

"NYT",1998,"Morocco","Cry of Muslim Women for Equal Rights Is Rising","The day Rashida was called to family court, she found herself in a scene that nearly stopped her heart. There, before the judge, was her husband of 10 years, father of her two children, the man she thought so enlightened when they first met at the university. That same man, she had just learned, was seeking the court's consent to marry a second wife. It took just minutes for the judge to approve. He ruled that the petitioner, who was a senior Government official, earned enough to maintain two families. Since her husband's second wedding, two years ago, Rashida has begged him in vain for a divorce and child support. Although she lives alone, she dares not think of remarrying. If she did, under Morocco's Islamic law, she would be likely to lose her children. ""This case is cruel, but it's mild compared to many others,"" said Fatima Elmaghnaoui, a counselor at a legal aid center for women. Rashida, who feared the consequences if her full name were published, still receives occasional checks from her husband. But that day, two women went to the center who had been repudiated by their husbands and left in the street with their children. A 14-year-old girl had been raped, leaving her pregnant and with nowhere to go. She could not return home. ""Her oldest brother said he would kill her for dishonoring the family,"" Mrs. Elmaghnaoui said. Such cases are common -- and not just in Morocco, which likes to see itself as one of the more cultured and humane lands among Arab nations. They occur throughout the Islamic world, where texts of the Koran and a range of appendages attached in later ages are invoked to deny equal rights to women. Protests against the humiliation of women in Islamic societies are hardly new. But more Islamic women's groups are speaking out against what they call the Muslim system of apartheid. The status of Muslim women varies widely. While some have gained rights, others have recently lost them. But like a deep fault line, the question of a woman's place runs through most of the Islamic world. Women and what they are forbidden to do or wear are at the heart of the fundamentalist policies in Afghanistan and Iran and are part of the agenda of the violent Islamist uprising in Algeria. The use of head scarves, an Islamic symbol, has been revived as an issue in universities in secular Turkey. And demands to abolish discrimination in Muslim family laws are testing official promises for greater democracy in Morocco, Tunisia and Malaysia. But even if these issues are ubiquitous, there has been little motion. ""Islamic countries have modernized many laws -- in the economy, education, commerce, politics, you name it,"" said Wassyla Tamzali, an Algerian lawyer and a specialist in Arab women's rights at Unesco. ""But there is practically no movement in the status of women. When it comes to women's rights, religion and theology are invoked. ""Change is so difficult because in Islam, women symbolize tradition and cultural identity. It is as if the whole burden of the Islamic tradition rests on their shoulders."" But a public, if relatively quiet, rebellion is under way. The activists do not get much limelight: they usually do not march in protest, either because it is forbidden or because they fear a backlash. But as International Women's Day, on March 8, approached this year, there was a multitude of debates, conferences and television programs about the issues across North Africa, from Morocco to Egypt. Because the movement is informal and ad hoc, statistics about participation or impact are hard to come by. Almost by definition, it revolves around educated women. In Morocco, Tunisia and Algeria, where women rank among the more emancipated of the Arab world, activists say the United Nations international women's conference in Beijing in 1995 was an important catalyst for defining the issues and planning action. But most important, they say, support has grown because women are caught in the growing contradictions and shifts within Islamic societies. One such shift, in the countries around the Mediterranean, has been the enormous migration from the countryside to the cities in recent years. As a result, more women now go to universities and work as doctors and lawyers as well as in factories and offices. But the archaic laws linger. ""Legally we are still as helpless as the illiterate girls on the farms,"" said Nouzha Skali, a Casablanca pharmacist. ""We are all legal minors, and we depend on permission of our fathers, brothers or husbands."" Educated or not, a Moroccan women needs the permission of a male relative to marry, name her children or work. She inherits half as much as her male siblings. She can be forced into marriage or polygamy and can be beaten or repudiated -- which is a man's exercise of his unilateral right to end the marriage -- without recourse. In conversations with Moroccan women -- social workers in Rabat, artists in Marrakesh -- and with female lawyers from several Arab countries who recently gathered in Paris, all agreed that the rise of Islamic fundamentalism had slowed and complicated their fight. But some believe that it has clarified the need to anchor any new rights in civil rather than religious law. ""Muslim feminists have long argued that it is not the religion but the male interpretation of the Koran that keeps women oppressed, along with the texts that were added on in the Middle Ages,"" said Mrs. Tamzali. ""So the way to reform seemed to be that we had to re-examine and reinterpret the religious texts. But efforts to reform Islam from within keep failing."" Islamic fundamentalists in Algeria, who have led a violent campaign for five years, and in Afghanistan, who have altogether cloistered women, have recently demonstrated how easy it is to turn back the clock by invoking religion. Many women now feel that they must fight to expand and change secular law, rather than reform the Sharia, the Islamic legal code, Mrs. Tamzali said. It is a discussion that means little to Zoubida Mhider, 48, who lives in poverty in Rabat. She is illiterate, like almost 70 percent of Moroccan women. In the waiting room of Annajda, a legal aid office in Rabat, she whispered that she had been beaten by her husband for so long that she finally left with her 11 children. For almost four years, Mrs. Mhider said, she has been going to court to beg for help with getting a divorce and seeking child support. Her husband usually fails to show up for court appointments, and the court has not pressed him. Two of the children have married, and she and the younger children have been getting by only on money her married daughter sometimes sends from the Netherlands. ""I just want this settled,"" she said, her body shaking under her long robe. Fatima Zahra Tamouh, a professor of African history at the University of Rabat, said that in Morocco and a number of countries, migration to the cities had brought more education for women but also more violence, repudiation and divorce. ""In the countryside, couples rarely lived alone,"" she said. ""A husband was accountable to the woman's family -- to her father, her brothers. But there is more abuse and more divorce and repudiation now that couples live alone. The problem is we've got a society more based on individuals without the laws to go with it."" In Rabat, Morocco's spacious and sunlit capital, women's groups are mobilizing to get divorce and child custody rules moved from the Mudawana, the Muslim family law, into the civil code. In 1993 women collected a million signatures in this nation of 28 million people to support such reform. King Hassan II agreed. But the reforms, drawn up by an all-male panel of theologians, have made little difference. This time, women say, they want a role in drafting the changes. ""For a man in Morocco, it is easier to get rid of his wife than to fire an employee,"" said Mrs. Skali, the pharmacist. Lawyers say that for a man it can take a few weeks to get a divorce and for a woman, five years or more. Equal rights in divorce and abolishing the one-sided act of repudiation are only one aspect of Muslim women's concerns, but in the big cities they affect almost 50 percent of couples, said Mrs. Skali, who also is president of the Association of Democratic Women, a rights group. ""We want to ring the alarm bell, because divorce is affecting our whole society,"" she said. ""The women are left on their own, with no support. It's one reason why we are seeing more and more street children.""","The day  was called to family court, she found herself in a scene that nearly stopped her heart.

"WP",2003,"Kuwait","Democracy in Kuwait Is Promise Unfulfilled","When a U.S.-led coalition liberated Kuwait from Iraqi occupation 12 years ago today, Masoumah Mubarak heard the promises from the ruling Sabah family. There would be political reforms. Parliament would be revived. Women would vote. ""Soon,"" the wealthy emirate's leaders said from their comfortable exile in Saudi Arabia. Mubarak, a professor of political science at Kuwait University, believed -- all the way through May 16, 1999, when the emir followed through on his pledge of eight years earlier and publicly endorsed women's voting rights. Then she saw what happened in Kuwait's National Assembly: The emir's words were put to the test, and the ruling family failed to put its political clout behind them. Women's rights lost by two votes in parliament and the emir never pushed the idea again. Mubarak no longer believes. Despite the prospect of another U.S.-led war against Iraq, one that President Bush says will foster democratization throughout the Middle East, many Kuwaitis look skeptically to the example of their own country. ""Nobody believes the war will bring democracy to the Arab world. Look at Kuwait. I don't buy it,"" Mubarak said. Although this country is smaller, richer and far less complex than neighboring Iraq, ""the new Kuwait"" promised by the emir, Sheik Jabir Ahmed Sabah, on his return 12 years ago has turned out to be a lot like the old Kuwait. Instead of moving toward more participatory government, as the United States urged, Kuwait's post-liberation history is one of limited change. The country remains a tightly controlled hereditary emirate with a 75-year-old ruler whose family wields unquestioned power. Women cannot vote or go to college with men. Political parties are not allowed. While hopes may have been boosted by earnest rhetoric out of Washington in 1991, the United States never publicly urged this key Persian Gulf ally to adopt reforms. The emir never made specific promises beyond his pledge to restore the National Assembly and consider the vote for women. The question of sharing the ruling family's power or changing the hereditary system apparently was not seriously considered. The parliament, which the ruler had suspended in 1986, was revived in 1991. Elections were held in 1992, 1996 and 1999 for the 14.8 percent of Kuwait's 860,000 citizens who are eligible to vote. But the balloting has produced a parliament in which the strongest political forces are conservative tribal leaders allied with Islamic fundamentalists, some of whom proclaim sympathy for Palestinian suicide bombers and Osama bin Laden. ""We hope this war would bring democracy to Iraq, but we all know democratization doesn't come by a statement from a foreign government,"" Mubarak said. ""Even if the United States spent millions of dollars on democracy, it wouldn't be so unless people are really believing in democracy, and so far in the Middle East, belief in democracy is not well rooted. None of the governments in the Middle East truly believes in democracy."" By many measures, Kuwait has a more thriving civil society than found elsewhere in the Persian Gulf region. It has a lively, critical press and a tradition of public debate in diwaniyas, private gatherings of Kuwaiti men at which the issues of the day are hashed over between gossip and kebabs. Parliament wields significant influence over the ruling family's government. Kuwait, which was granted independence from Britain in 1961, has a 1962 constitution that on paper offers significant guarantees of civil rights. But it is a place with not a single legally recognized human rights organization. It is a country that has failed to carry out significant economic liberalization and where the ruling family maintains exclusive power over the legal system. It is a two-tiered society in which citizens enjoy privileges denied to the other 1.4 million residents, most of them foreign workers from poorer parts of the Arab world and South Asia. Non-Muslims are denied citizenship even if they are born here; among Kuwaiti citizens, only men 21 and older have the right to vote. Twelve years ago, the State Department report on human rights criticized the limited voting rights and cited ""restrictions on freedom of assembly and speech, the right of citizens to change their government, women and workers' rights, and instances of arbitrary arrest, mistreatment of prisoners and lack of due process."" The most recent report, issued last March, contains much the same list: human rights abuses by some members of the security forces, judges appointed only by the emir, ""a pattern of bias against foreign residents,"" discrimination against non-citizens, censorship of ""morally offensive"" materials, restricted freedom of assembly and a tradition of discrimination by the Sunni Muslim establishment against a Shiite Muslim minority that makes up 30 percent of the population. Many independent analysts and members of Kuwait's embittered but vocal group of Western-oriented reformers point to the ruling family's tacit alliance with Islamic fundamentalists as a reason for limited progress toward more participatory government. ""You expected, after the liberation, the government will jump after the Americans,"" said Shamlan Essa, a political scientist at Kuwait University. ""Instead, they are trying to please the Islamic fundamentalists."" Essa ticked off a long list of the ruling family's bows toward Islamic sentiment in the years since liberation. They include an emir-appointed committee on ""Islamicization of the law,"" refusal to register non-government groups except Islamic charities and new education policies adding religious instruction. In parliament, Islamic fundamentalists have teamed up with conservative tribal leaders to become the most powerful voting bloc. Only two members of parliament come from the National Democratic Forum, an umbrella group of reformers. Islamic political leaders say that is proof that representative institutions, no matter how limited, work in Kuwait. ""Yes, we have more power now than before the liberation,"" said Mubarak Dawailah, leader of the Islamic fundamentalists' parliamentary group. ""That's because we are the most powerful group in society."" ""Whenever there is true democracy, the Islamists will prevail,"" said Abdul Razak Shuyji, a leader of the conservative Salafi movement. To their critics, however, the fundamentalists' influence has blocked progress toward the reforms advocated by the United States after the 1991 war. ""We've lost the 12 years since the liberation because of the resistance of the political Islamic movement,"" said Saud Nasir Sabah, oil minister and a former ambassador to the United States. ""They do not welcome any further U.S. or Western investment in the country."" For Sabah, the proof is the parliament's long resistance to opening the country's rich northern oil fields to multinational companies with the technology to develop them. ""It's dead now,"" he said. ""It's back to square one."" Amer Tameemi, chairman of the Kuwait Economic Society, noted that the government, flush with oil revenue, still employs 93 percent of all Kuwaitis who work. Islamic leaders in parliament, he said, have enhanced their political appeal by vowing to keep those government jobs. Still, he said he believes that change in Iraq will spur change elsewhere in the Middle East. ""Once you have democracy in Iraq, many of the political regimes in the area will be forced to reform as well,"" he said. A large, if often silent, minority in Kuwait agrees, hoping that a war in Iraq would result in reforms here. That group includes people like Nora Dandashi, a Syrian-born journalist working here who says she will not return to her country until ""you Americans clean up the region and make democracy everywhere."" Fadil Sayafi, a 31-year-old with a degree from the University of Miami and an American wife, is also among its number. In his widely shared view, the forces of modernization and Islamic tradition are bound to clash. Only a war in Iraq and a major change in the regional balance of power toward democracy might improve it, Sayafi said. ""War in Iraq could bring more democracy to this country, relieve the pressure,"" he said. ""It could give our government relief so they can change their internal policies."" But many Kuwaitis who favor democracy say that the experience of the last 12 years has been a frustrating exercise in unfulfilled promises. ""There is not a democratic system in Kuwait, there is not democracy here,"" said Mohammed Qadiri, a former diplomat. ""We are marginally better than our neighbors, but this is not democracy."" Qadiri quit the Foreign Ministry over the dissolution of parliament in 1986. He stayed in Kuwait during the seven-month Iraqi occupation in 1990-91 and joined the resistance, until he was arrested by Iraqi soldiers three days before U.S. and allied Arab forces arrived. Like many Kuwaitis, he was bitter at the swift flight of the emir and other members of the ruling family when Iraq overran Kuwait on Aug. 2, 1990, and hoped that liberation would bring a new, more progressive generation to power. But that hasn't happened, Qadiri said. The emir, who is ailing, has been on the throne for more than 25 years.  Crown Prince Saad Abdullah Sabah is about the same age -- and is also ill. The chief power broker, Sabah Ahmed Sabah, is one of the longest-serving foreign ministers in the world, having held the job with one interruption since 1978. Qadiri spoke at the regular Sunday night diwaniya he hosts with his wife. They started it as soon as he returned from an Iraqi prison in April 1991. It is one of a handful of mixed-sex diwaniyas in the country, and he has found that most Kuwaitis will not accept it. ""Kuwaitis don't want to bring their wife to a diwaniya,"" he said. ""They are not ready for it.""","When a -led coalition liberated  from  occupation 12 years ago today,  heard the promises from the ruling  family. There would be political reforms.

Fadil Sayafi, a 31-year-old with a degree from the University of Miami and an American wife, is also among its number. In his widely shared view, the forces of modernization and Islamic tradition are bound to clash. Only a war in  and a major change in the regional balance of power toward democracy might improve it, Sayafi said. ""War in  could bring more democracy to this country, relieve the pressure,"" he said. ""It could give our government relief so they can change their internal policies."" But many s who favor democracy say that the experience of the last 12 years has been a frustrating exercise in unfulfilled promises. ""There is not a democratic system in , there is not democracy here,"" said Mohammed Qadiri, a former diplomat. ""We are marginally better than our neighbors, but this is not democracy."" Qadiri quit the Foreign Ministry over the dissolution of parliament in 1986. He stayed in  during the seven-month  occupation in 1990-91 and joined the resistance, until he was arrested by  soldiers three days before  and allied Arab forces arrived. Like many s, he was bitter at the swift flight of the emir and other members of the ruling family when  overran  on Aug. 2, 1990, and hoped that liberation would bring a new, more progressive generation to power. But that hasn't happened, Qadiri said. The emir, who is ailing, has been on the throne for more than 25 years.  Crown Prince Saad Abdullah  is about the same age -- and is also ill. The chief power broker,  Ahmed , is one of the longest-serving foreign ministers in the world, having held the job with one interruption since 1978. Qadiri spoke at the regular Sunday night diwaniya he hosts with his wife. They started it as soon as he returned from an  prison in April 1991. It is one of a handful of mixed-sex  in the country, and he has found that most s will not accept it. ""s don't want to bring their wife to a diwaniya,"" he said. ""They are not ready for it."""
"NYT",2013,"Afghanistan","Despite West's Efforts, Afghan Youths Cling to Traditional Ways","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Walk through the streets of Kabul and evidence of the West's decade-long war literally clings to the Afghan youth: the American labels emblazoned on their shirts and jeans, the stylish sunglasses they wear, the cellphones they clutch to update their lives on Twitter and Facebook. To those who like to think that the foreign presence here has left more than spent shells and hollowed-out buildings, what the young people of Kabul wear and value can itself offer a sense of comfort. These trappings of the West, the hope goes, belong to a generation ready to embrace women's rights, democracy and other ideals that America and its allies have spent billions of dollars trying to instill. But interviews with dozens of Afghan youth paint a picture of a new generation bound to their society's conservative ways, especially when it comes to women's rights, one of the West's single most important efforts here. Attempts to alter women's roles in society remain controversial among the younger generation, perhaps the starkest example of the West's limited influence as coalition forces prepare to withdraw next year. ''If someone thinks that youngsters have changed, they should think twice,'' said Amina Mustaqim Jawid, the director of the Afghan Women's Coalition Against Corruption. ''These young men grew up in a war environment. They don't know about their own rights; how can we expect them to know about their sisters' rights, their mothers' rights or their wives' rights? If they wear jeans and have Western haircuts, that doesn't mean they are progressive.'' Even in Kabul, one of the most liberal cities in Afghanistan, many young men and women express beliefs that fly in the face of the messages coming from American Embassy outreach efforts. Censorship, particularly when it comes to religious offenses, summons little ire. Many consider democracy a tool of the West. And the vast majority of Afghans still rely on tribal justice, viewing the courts as little more than venues of extortion. On a recent afternoon, young women gathered on the third floor of a wedding hall, enduring the stifling heat in black niqabs to protest a recently proposed law aimed at protecting the rights of Afghan women. The men remained outside, forming a barricade along the busy street to prevent strangers from entering the hall. One poster read, ''I am a Self-Aware Woman, I Will Not Be Deceived by the Empty Slogans of the West.'' ''This law is not only against Islamic values; it is also against all other ethical values,'' one protester, Saida Hafiz, said to a crowd of about 200 young women and children assembled in the room. ''If we remain silent today, soon our society will be morally corrupted like that of the West.'' Such impressions can be heard throughout the city: in the shared street taxis that cart Kabulis across town, in the bustling cafes of the city's sparkling Shar-e Naw neighborhood, even on the campuses of the nation's most prestigious universities. Group taxi rides, which serve as Kabul's de facto bus system, offer an unfiltered view of the local perspective. On board, men of all ages speak openly about everything from politics to traffic -- often in the presence of women. On a recent evening, a crowd idled downtown along Enhesarat Street, waiting for cars and minivans amid a cacophony of horns and engines. A few men piled into a dusty minivan headed for Taimani 2, an area in West Kabul. As the minivan lurched along the pockmarked roads, they chatted about a recent shoe-throwing fight between two female parliamentarians. ''Who let these women into Parliament?'' said an old man with red hair and blue eyes, his knees pressed against his chest. ''Women were meant to stay at home.'' A young man seated beside him, holding books on his lap and dressed in a blue T-shirt and gray pants, nodded in agreement. On another trip, from the neighborhood of Kolola Pushta back downtown, a similar scene unfolded. A young student from the Afghan-Korea Vocational Institute, dressed in a blazer and slacks, brought up a recent Western public art project, where young men and women doled out pink balloons to passers-by. ''Did you see what those girls were wearing?'' he asked another passenger, citing the women's short sleeves and fitted pants. ''If my sister dressed like that, I would kill her.'' Protests proliferated in the days after the bill concerning women's rights was introduced. Though lawmakers almost immediately blocked it, given the outcry from religious leaders, supporters promised to reintroduce the legislation, setting off a wave of debate. The measure would essentially cement rights that have ostensibly been in place through presidential decree for several years -- including protections against child marriage, polygamy and violence against women. About 200 male students flooded the gates of Kabul University, the nation's most prestigious public university, calling for an end to the bill and the presidential decree. Gathered with a small group of friends after the protest, which he did not attend, Mohammad Taib, 19, said the draft was in conflict with Islam. ''Those who are pushing for the approval of the law, they are doing it to make Westerners happy,'' Mr. Taib said. ''Those with independent ideas are strictly against it.'' His friend Mohammad Haroun, added: ''I believe in women's rights, but in strict accordance with Islam.'' In reality, a lot of what is thought to be Shariah law in Afghanistan is actually tribal tradition. Some of the most severe cultural practices, like the selling of young girls to pay off debt, are elements of Pashtun code that would be unacceptable in most other Islamic countries. ''That's a huge problem,'' said Din Mohammad Gran, the dean of Kabul University's Shariah law school, who does not support the women's rights bill. ''Some people have a misinterpretation of Islam that they learned from the wrong sources.'' While conservative voices are easy enough to find in and around the capital, Kabul is not without its progressive pockets. Groups like Afghanistan 1400, a collection of young Afghan leaders committed to social and political change, are often cited as the vanguard of civic activism. Corporate workplaces have also become surprising petri dishes for quiet activism. At Tolonews, one of the country's largest television news organizations, men find themselves working for women as economic realities scuttle normal social dynamics. This, in part, reflects what some observers say is the chasm between the public and private behavior of many Afghans, who are not as conservative as they seem. ''Our traditions and conventions are telling us one thing, and the realities on the ground are telling us something else,'' said Saad Mohseni, the founder of Tolonews. ''People are actually acting in a very different way from how they are talking.'' Some young Afghan women have taken the issue head-on, opting to speak out publicly for their rights. While they know their struggle lies along the outer edge of the accepted social protests for women, activists like Noor Jahan Akbar have adopted the long view. ''After 30 years of war, what do you expect?'' asked Ms. Akbar, a young blogger who helped organize a recent demonstration supporting the bill. ''A mind-set built over 100 years takes longer than 10 years to change.'' Ms. Akbar and about 100 other women and a handful of men began their protest one morning near the entrance to the Afghan Parliament, shouting slogans from a megaphone and carting banners. As the day wore on, whispers circulated that the Shariah law students were coming to violently upend the protest. Police officers massed along the periphery, their battering rods and plastic shields raised. Suddenly, hundreds of men emerged from behind the police, shouting chants and carrying banners. The crowd easily eclipsed Ms. Akbar's protesters, snarling traffic along the road. But these demonstrators were not focused on women's rights. They were riled up in support of a Kabul University dean accused of mistreating minority students.

"NYT",2008,"Germany","Discoverers of AIDS and Cancer Viruses Win Nobel","The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded Monday to three European scientists who had discovered viruses behind two devastating illnesses, AIDS and cervical cancer. Half of the award will be shared by two French virologists, Francoise Barre-Sinoussi, 61, and Luc A. Montagnier, 76, for discovering H.I.V., the virus that causes AIDS. Conspicuously omitted was Dr. Robert C. Gallo, an American virologist who vied with the French team in a long, often acrimonious dispute over credit for the discovery of H.I.V. The other half of the $1.4 million award will go to a German physician-scientist, Dr. Harald zur Hausen, 72, for his discovery of H.P.V., or the human papilloma virus. Dr. zur Hausen of the German Cancer Research Center in Heidelberg ''went against current dogma'' by postulating that the virus caused cervical cancer, said the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, which selects the medical winners of the prize, formally called the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine. His discovery led to the development of two vaccines against cervical cancer, the second most common cancer among women. An estimated 250,000 women die of cervical cancer each year, mostly in poor countries. This year's Nobel Prize-winning research focused on two viruses that take many years to cause damage. Much of the research was carried out a quarter of a century or more ago. Since its discovery in 1981, AIDS has rivaled the worst epidemics in history. An estimated 25 million people have died, and 33 million more are living with H.I.V. In 1983, Dr. Montagnier and Dr. Barre-Sinoussi, a member of his lab at the Pasteur Institute in Paris, published their report of a newly identified virus. The Karolinska Institute said that discovery led to blood tests to detect the infection and to anti-retroviral drugs that can prolong the lives of patients. The tests are now used to screen blood donations, making the blood supply safer for transfusions and blood products. The viral discovery has also led to an understanding of the natural history of H.I.V. infection in people, which ultimately leads to AIDS and death unless treated. H.I.V. is a member of the lentivirus family of viruses. The French scientists were cited for identifying a virus they called L.A.V. (now known as H.I.V.) in lymph nodes from early and late stages of the infection. ''Never before has science and medicine been so quick to discover, identify the origin and provide treatment for a new disease entity,'' the Karolinska Institute said. Reached by the Nobel committee in Abidjan, Ivory Coast, where he is attending an international AIDS conference, Dr. Montagnier said, ''The fight is not finished'' and  he was now working on a way to eradicate H.I.V. in those already infected. Dr. Montagnier now works at the World Foundation for AIDS Research and Prevention in Paris. Nobel Foundation rules limit the number of recipients of   its   medical prizes to a maximum of three each year, and omissions often create controversy. The dispute between Dr. Gallo and the French team spanned years and sprawled from the lab into the highest levels of government. Dr. Gallo, 71, now at the University of Maryland in Baltimore, worked for many years at the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md. While in Bethesda in 1984, a year after the French team's report, Dr. Gallo reported finding a virus that he called H.T.L.V.-3 and that was later shown to be nearly identical to the French L.A.V. After additional studies, Dr. Gallo said cultures in his laboratory had accidentally become contaminated with the French virus. In 1986, Dr. Gallo and Dr. Montagnier shared a prestigious Lasker award, given in the United States; Dr. Montagnier was cited for discovering the virus and Dr. Gallo for determining that it caused AIDS. In 1987, President Reagan and Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France signed an agreement to share royalties and credit for the discovery. But Maria Masucci, a member of the Nobel Assembly, told Reuters on Monday that ''there was no doubt as to who made the fundamental discoveries.'' Dr. Gallo told The Associated Press on Monday that it was ''a disappointment'' not to have been honored with the French team. Later, Dr. Gallo issued a statement congratulating this year's Nobel Prize winners and said he ''was gratified to read Dr. Montagnier's kind statement this morning expressing that I was equally deserving.'' Dr. John E. Niederhuber, the director of the National Cancer Institute, said Monday that Dr. Gallo ''was instrumental in every major aspect of the discovery of the AIDS virus. Dr. Gallo discovered interleukein-2 (Il-2), an immune system signaling molecule, which was necessary for the discovery of the AIDS virus, serving as a co-culture factor that allowed the virus to grow. Numerous scientific journal articles, many co-authored by Dr. Gallo and Dr. Montagnier, cite the two scientists as co-discoverers of the AIDS virus.'' Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, a virologist and immunologist who directs the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, said in an interview, ''The committee has a long history of awarding the prize to the person or group that makes the first seminal observation or discovery, and they did that in this case.'' He added, ''Nobel Prizes are always associated with great joy and great sadness, depending on who wins and who you are.'' The link between human papilloma virus and cervical cancer took years to gain acceptance. When Dr. zur Hausen proposed the connection in the 1970s, infection with papilloma virus was thought to cause nothing more serious than common warts, and the prevailing scientific view was that herpes type 2 virus caused cervical cancer. But Dr. zur Hausen consistently failed to find herpes type 2 DNA in cervical cancer cells using the newer molecular biology laboratory techniques. In the 1980s, an American researcher said that financing agencies in the United States had rejected as unpromising his grant proposals to study links between papilloma viruses and cancer. The National Institutes of Health did not reply on Monday to questions about such proposals. In 1983, Dr. zur Hausen discovered the first H.P.V., type 16, among biopsies of women who had cervical cancer. He went on to show that more than one H.P.V. type could lead to cervical cancer, in part by cloning H.P.V. 16 and another type, 18. Further research has shown that the two H.P.V. types are consistently found in about 70 percent of cervical cancer biopsies throughout the world, the institute said. Dr. zur Hausen's research has led to development of vaccines that protect against strains of H.P.V. that cause most cases of cervical cancers. However, controversy has arisen over who should get the vaccines. An earlier version of this article referred incorrectly to the office Jacques Chirac held at the time of his 1987 agreement with President Reagan.","The Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded Monday to three European scientists who had discovered viruses behind two devastating illnesses, AIDS and cervical cancer.

"NYT",2013,"Afghanistan","Effort to Strengthen an Afghan Law on Women May Backfire","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Even with some legal protections in place, Afghan women, and sometimes even little girls, can be sold to pay family debts. In the country's vast rural areas, just talking to a man who is not a close relative can be punishable by death. And in some places, girls are routinely married at puberty. And now, preserving any protections long-term appears to be in question, as the country's tiny women's rights movement faces an unenviable decision: leave intact the only law that attempts to halt such abuses, or continue to present changes to Parliament and run the risk that a growing conservative bloc could dismantle the law entirely. The quandary became evident on Saturday, when a bid to add more robust protections was rapidly withdrawn in Parliament after stinging rebukes. Angry mullahs and conservatives who never supported the law in the first place complained that it and the proposed revisions were un-Islamic and asked who could better decide than they who and when their daughters should marry. Some women in Parliament were not supportive either, citing the measure's backing of shelters for battered women. Many Afghans believe shelters are little better than brothels and tarnish a girl's reputation. To cut off the onslaught, the proposal was sent back to committee, its future uncertain. The push to bring up the law in Parliament has split the small group of Afghan women's rights advocates. Despite fears of the conservatives, some argued that quick action had to be taken before the exit of the United States, which, along with the European Union, has championed better lives and protections for Afghan women. But others resisted. ''We know who is in the Parliament,'' said Soraya Sobrang, a women's rights activist and part of a hastily organized effort to stop the law from coming up in Parliament, referring to the former militia commanders, mullahs and other conservatives who take a dim view of many Western-backed protections for women. What would stop them, she asked, ''from pulling a list from their back pocket'' of changes that would weaken the protections against child marriage or even rape? The drive to amend the law was led by one of Afghanistan's more visible champions for women's issues: Fawzia Koofi, a determined, ambitious woman who gained a seat in Parliament in 2005 and in 2010, survived an attempt on her life by gunmen thought to be Taliban. ''There is a step back on women's issues,'' Ms. Koofi said, explaining her drive to revise the law in the plenary session of Parliament this weekend. ''The government used to be more supportive.'' Ms. Koofi is a somewhat controversial figure. Closely allied with the predominantly Tajik former Northern Alliance faction in Parliament, she has sometimes been criticized as pursuing policies for her own political gain. However, she insisted that her motivation to amend the women's law was to help solidify it, though not all supporters of women's rights here agree. Ms. Koofi said the proposed changes would allow the government to prosecute cases of abuse even when the woman who had been abused withdrew her claim. Women frequently come under family pressure to drop complaints of domestic violence. Ms. Koofi said she also added a provision prohibiting sexual harassment, calling it increasingly pervasive as more women go to work in offices. And, she said, she included a provision to require men to pay women child support if they leave them or take other wives. No written version of the amendments was publicly available, so it was difficult to verify their contents or wording. The law -- the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act -- was issued in 2009 as a decree by President Hamid Karzai. In a first for the country, it outlined basic protections from practices common throughout Afghanistan, including child marriage, forced marriage, physical abuse and the practice of giving women in marriage to settle disputes between families, called baad. Ms. Koofi said her prime worry was that, with elections due in less than a year, the law might be annulled by a new president. Parliament's endorsement would enshrine it more securely, she argued. ''If we wait for the best moment when there is no opposition, we will wait forever,'' she said. ''Our worry is that things will get worse after 2014, and there's no guarantee that the next president will support the women's issues. We should have done it even earlier.'' Women who opposed Ms. Koofi's gambit said they were resigned that it might already be too late to do more in Parliament than safeguard the current law. ''It's gambling with the law with this kind of Parliament,'' said Mahbooba Saraj, a women's advocate who joined a news conference at the offices of the Afghan Women's Network, one of the larger women's rights organizations here, to urge that Parliament remove discussion of the act from its agenda this weekend. ''It's a gamble with the lives of Afghan women.'' Last week, the Afghan Women's Network, along with a number of Kabul-based civil society organizations, began sending out alarmed e-mails to embassies and international organizations, as well as reporters, to rally opposition to the effort to revise the law. Western diplomats in Kabul also strongly advised Ms. Koofi not to push ahead with a full debate unless she was absolutely sure that the law could be protected from evisceration. Georgette Gagnon, the head of the human rights office for the United Nations here, who has studied how the law has been carried out, described taking the measure before the Parliament as ''fraught with all kinds of risk.'' ''Ultimately, the losers could be millions of Afghan women,'' she said. The existing law is far from ideal. Human rights lawyers say it lacks a definition of honor crimes and offers little clarity on how the police or prosecutors should treat a woman who runs away from home to escape violence. Often a woman who flees is imprisoned on charges that she intended to commit adultery; numerous women interviewed in jails by the United Nations for its 2012 report on the law's enforcement said they left home to avoid a forced marriage or domestic violence. And women come under enormous family pressure to drop any charge of domestic violence. Enforcement remains woefully insufficient: in the first full year that the law was put into effect, from 2010 to 2011, courts relied on it in just 4 percent of the 2,299 reported episodes that could be defined as crimes under the measure, according to a November 2011 report by the United Nations human rights division. However, prosecutors have begun to use the law, especially in the larger urban areas like Kabul and Herat, and human rights groups hope that as prosecutors become familiar with it, they will rely on it more frequently. At a minimum, the law provides a basic set of protections for women that prosecutors, judges, lawyers for women and women's advocates can look to in determining whether prosecutable abuses have occurred. ''The potential risk of opening this Pandora's box is enormous,'' said Heather Barr, the director of the Human Rights Watch office for Afghanistan, referring to the risks inherent in letting the full Parliament reconsider each provision. ''Just look at a photograph of the Parliament. What planet would you have to be on to think that they would vote to send themselves to prison if they married off their under-aged daughter, or send themselves to jail if they beat their wives?''",",  -- Even with some legal protections in place,  women, and sometimes even little girls, can be sold to pay family debts. In the country's vast rural areas, just talking to a man who is not a close relative can be punishable by death. And in some places, girls are routinely married at puberty. And now, preserving any protections long-term appears to be in question, as the country's tiny women's rights movement faces an unenviable decision: leave intact the only law that attempts to halt such abuses, or continue to present changes to  and run the risk that a growing conservative bloc could dismantle the law entirely. The quandary became evident on Saturday, when a bid to add more robust protections was rapidly withdrawn in  after stinging rebukes. Angry mullahs and conservatives who never supported the law in the first place complained that it and the proposed revisions were un-Islamic and asked who could better decide than they who and when their daughters should marry. Some women in  were not supportive either, citing the measure's backing of shelters for battered women. Many s believe shelters are little better than brothels and tarnish a girl's reputation. To cut off the onslaught, the proposal was sent back to committee, its future uncertain. The push to bring up the law in  has split the small group of  women's rights advocates. Despite fears of the conservatives, some argued that quick action had to be taken before the exit of the , which, along with the , has championed better lives and protections for  women. But others resisted. ''We know who is in the ,'' said , a women's rights activist and part of a hastily organized effort to stop the law from coming up in , referring to the former militia commanders, mullahs and other conservatives who take a dim view of many Western-backed protections for women. What would stop them, she asked, ''from pulling a list from their back pocket'' of changes that would weaken the protections against child marriage or even rape? The drive to amend the law was led by one of 's more visible champions for women's issues: , a determined, ambitious woman who gained a seat in  in 2005 and in 2010, survived an attempt on her life by gunmen thought to be Taliban. ''There is a step back on women's issues,'' Ms.  said, explaining her drive to revise the law in the plenary session of  this weekend. ''The government used to be more supportive.'' Ms.  is a somewhat controversial figure. Closely allied with the predominantly Tajik former  faction in , she has sometimes been criticized as pursuing policies for her own political gain. However, she insisted that her motivation to amend the women's law was to help solidify it, though not all supporters of women's rights here agree. Ms.  said the proposed changes would allow the government to prosecute cases of abuse even when the woman who had been abused withdrew her claim. Women frequently come under family pressure to drop complaints of domestic violence. Ms.  said she also added a provision prohibiting sexual harassment, calling it increasingly pervasive as more women go to work in offices. And, she said, she included a provision to require men to pay women child support if they leave them or take other wives. No written version of the amendments was publicly available, so it was difficult to verify their contents or wording. The law -- the Elimination of Violence Against Women Act -- was issued in 2009 as a decree by President . In a first for the country, it outlined basic protections from practices common throughout , including child marriage, forced marriage, physical abuse and the practice of giving women in marriage to settle disputes between families, called baad. Ms.  said her prime worry was that, with elections due in less than a year, the law might be annulled by a new president. 's endorsement would enshrine it more securely, she argued. ''If we wait for the best moment when there is no opposition, we will wait forever,'' she said. ''Our worry is that things will get worse after 2014, and there's no guarantee that the next president will support the women's issues. We should have done it even earlier.''

"NYT",2010,"United Kingdom","Eileen Nearne, Wartime Spy, Dies at 89","LONDON -- After she died earlier this month, a frail 89-year-old alone in a flat in the British seaside town of Torquay, Eileen Nearne, her body undiscovered for several days, was listed by local officials as a candidate for what is known in Britain as a council burial, or what in the past was called a pauper's grave. But after the police looked through her possessions, including a Croix de Guerre medal awarded to her by the French government after World War II, the obscurity Ms. Nearne had cultivated for decades began to slip away. Known to her neighbors as an insistently private woman who loved cats and revealed almost nothing about her past, she has emerged as a heroine in the tortured story of Nazi-occupied France, one of the secret agents who helped prepare the French resistance for the D-Day landings in June 1944. On Tuesday, the anonymity that Ms. Nearne had cherished in life was denied her in death. A funeral service in Torquay featured a military bugler and piper and an array of uniformed mourners. A red cushion atop her coffin bore her wartime medals. Eulogies celebrated her as one of 39 British women who were parachuted into France as secret agents by the Special Operations Executive, a wartime agency known informally as ''Churchill's secret army,'' which recruited more than 14,000 agents to conduct espionage and sabotage behind enemy lines. Funeral costs were paid by the British Legion, the country's main veterans' organization, and by anonymous donors who came forward after the circumstances of Ms. Nearne's death made front-page news in Britain. The funeral organizers said that in accordance with her wishes, her ashes would be scattered at sea. Ms. Nearne, known as Didi, volunteered for work that was as dangerous as any that wartime Britain had to offer: operating a secret radio link from Paris that was used to organize weapons drops to the French resistance and to shuttle messages back and forth between controllers in London and the resistance. After several narrow escapes, she was arrested by the Gestapo in July 1944 and sent to the Ravensbruck concentration camp near Berlin, a camp that was primarily intended for women, tens of thousands of whom died there. Ms. Nearne survived, though other women working for the Special Operations Executive were executed in the Nazi camps. As she related in postwar debriefings, documented in Britain's National Archives, the Gestapo tortured her -- beating her, stripping her naked, then submerging her repeatedly in a bath of ice-cold water until she began to black out from lack of oxygen. Yet they failed to force her to yield the secrets they sought: her real identity, the names of others working with her in the resistance and the assignments given to her by London. At the time, she was 23. The account she gave her captors was that she was an innocent and somewhat gullible Frenchwoman named Jacqueline Duterte, and that she had been recruited by a local businessman to transmit radio coded messages that she did not understand. She recalled one interrogator's attempts to break her will: ''He said, 'Liar! Spy!' and hit me on the face. He said, 'We have ways of making people who don't want to talk, talk. Come with us.' '' From Ravensbruck, Ms. Nearne was shuttled eastward through an archipelago of Nazi death camps, her head shaved. After first refusing to work in the camps, she changed her mind, seeing the work assignments as the only means of survival. In December 1944 she was moved to the Markleberg camp, near Leipzig, where she worked on a road-repair gang for 12 hours a day. But while being transferred yet again, she and two Frenchwomen escaped and eventually linked up with American troops. Even then, her travails were not over. American intelligence officers initially identified her as a Nazi collaborator and held her at a detention center with captured SS personnel until her account, that she was a British secret agent, was verified by her superiors in London. Asked by her postwar debriefers how she kept up hope, she replied: ''The will to live. Willpower. That's the most important. You should not let yourself go. It seemed that the end would never come, but I always believed in destiny, and I had a hope.'' ''If you are a person who is drowning, you put all your efforts into trying to swim.'' Ms. Nearne was born on March 15, 1921, into an Anglo-Spanish family that later moved to France, where she grew up speaking French. The family fled to Spain ahead of the German occupation of France, arriving in Britain in 1942. Ms. Nearne, her older sister, Jacqueline, and their brother, Francis, were recruited by the Special Operations Executive. In March 1944, Didi Nearne followed her sister in parachuting into France, remaining there, under the code name Agent Rose, after her sister was airlifted back to Britain. The Gestapo had infiltrated many of the Allied spying networks, and Ms. Nearne lived on a knife's edge. On a train journey to a new safe house south of Paris, her cover came close to being blown when a German soldier offered to carry her suitcase, which contained her secret radio. After telling him that it contained a gramophone, she hurriedly got off the train and walked with the case the rest of the way. Describing how she lived undercover, she said after the war: ''I wasn't nervous. In my mind, I was never going to be arrested. But of course I was careful. There were Gestapo in plain clothes everywhere. I always looked at my reflection in the shop windows to see if I was being followed.'' In July 1944, the Gestapo arrived at her Paris hide-out moments after she had completed a coded transmission. She burned the messages and hid the radio, but the Germans found the radio and the pad she had used for coding the transmissions. Parts of her story were later told in books written about wartime secret operations, including the 1966 history ''SOE in France, 1940-1944,'' by Michael Foot, part of a government history series by authors given special access to secret government records. But wartime friends said after her death, on Sept. 2, that she had found it difficult to adjust to peacetime life, and a medical report in the government archives said she was suffering from psychological symptoms brought on by her wartime service. She never married, and she lived alone after her sister died in 1982. Friends said that she withdrew into herself and shunned all opportunities to earn celebrity from her wartime experiences. In 1993, she returned to Ravensbruck for a visit, but otherwise she cherished her anonymity. As she told an interviewer several years before she died: ''It was a life in the shadows, but I was suited for it. I could be hard and secret. I could be lonely. I could be independent. But I wasn't bored. I liked the work.

"WP",2010,"Iran","Feminism, by way of the Koran","How Women Are Transforming the Middle East By Isobel Coleman Random House. 315 pp. $26 After Iran's 1979 Islamic revolution, women were barred from working as judges or attending soccer matches, forced to wear hijab, and declared unequal to men in the realms of inheritance, testimony and divorce -- all under the pretext of hewing to Islamic tenets. But something interesting happened on the way back from the revolution, as Isobel Coleman describes in her new book, ""Paradise Beneath Her Feet."" As Iran's mullahs tightened control, women from conservative religious families who had never had a voice began to ride the very Islamic wave that seemed to be rising against them. Those who had been active in the revolution now elbowed their way into political and civil society, and universities were soon packed with women. Though it did so unintentionally, ""the Islamic takeover made formal girls' schooling acceptable to even the most conservative families,"" Coleman writes. ""Now that society was Islamized -- with girls wearing hijab and schools and many public places segregated -- how could a father say no?"" As fathers began to say yes, Iran's male-dominated leadership was busy isolating iteself from the international community. But Iranian women were connecting with the outside world: Their One Million Signatures campaign against discriminatory laws drew global recognition; the human rights lawyer Shirin Ebadi won the Nobel Peace Prize; and one year ago last week, when Iranians took to the streets to protest suspicious election results, the symbol of the Iranian resistance became Neda Agha-Soltan, the young woman whose death was broadcast on YouTube. It's not what the mullahs had in mind, but the trajectory of Iran's women gives Coleman hope that even in Muslim societies that present cultural and political obstacles, women are finding opportunities to rise up -- and to bring their countries up with them. The key, she writes, is to do so within Islamic paradigms. The director of the Council on Foreign Relations' Women and Foreign Policy program, Coleman traveled throughout the Muslim world, visiting relatively egalitarian societies such as Indonesia but focusing especially on five countries where women's rights are most tenuous -- Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and Iraq -- to support her view that while keeping women down keeps a nation down, the battle for gender equality is a continuing process and women are becoming smarter about engaging it. She introduces us to female politicians, journalists, entrepreneurs and educators, urban and rural, who are making impressive inroads, and she cites studies showing that societies that educate and invest in women become ""richer, more stable, better governed and less prone to fanaticism,"" while those that limit women's opportunities ""are poorer, more fragile, have higher levels of corruption and are more prone to extremism."" Despite the advances of women in places such as Iran, she argues that such countries are not nearly as advanced as they could be if women's opportunities were equal to men's. Women's rights have been slow to blossom in the Middle East, Coleman writes, in part because the principle is often associated with Westernization. Twentieth-century West-leaning modernizers such as Mustafa Kemal Ataturk bluntly denounced the veil without acknowledging its complex effect on society, while current politicians seek legitimacy by catering to anti-Western religious conservatives and sacrificing women's rights along the way. ""Islamic feminism"" can be a loaded term among those who see feminism as an illegitimate Western import. But according to Coleman, reform within an Islamic framework is the most promising avenue toward women's advancement. She introduces us to Muslims, both religious and secular, who engage in ijtihad, ""the process of arriving at new interpretations of Islamic law through critical reasoning, rather than blindly following the views of past scholars."" They use the Koran to show that gender inequality isn't an Islamic concept so much as a cultural one, and that extreme practices against women represent ""a subversion of Islamic teaching, its corruption by tribal customs and traditions."" Traditional societies do not tend to tolerate change imposed from the top, however, and turning ijtihad into action requires delicate maneuvering by insiders who can work with mullahs and politicians and resist the urge to superimpose Western-style feminism on Eastern societies. ""I don't want to criticize the work of foreigners,"" says Sakena Yacoobi, an Afghan woman Coleman meets who runs a women's health and education nonprofit, ""but when they come here and start teaching the women about their rights, the women often go home and criticize their husbands and their life just gets worse. We are helping the women learn how to negotiate with their husbands. The Quran is most helpful for that."" Coleman's feminists use modern technology to promote their message: Advocacy groups bombard policymakers with e-mail, and activists use YouTube to broadcast abuses captured on cellphone videos. An Egyptian television sex therapist who is popular across the Arab world uses the Koran to recommend foreplay, and an actor portraying a religious leader on a radio soap opera in rural Pakistan deprecates women to spark discussion among the show's characters and listeners. Coleman acknowledges the fragility of women's advancement. Hard-won rights have withered in the face of war, revolution and restrictive religious trends. In Iraq, for example, women in the early secular years of Baathist rule enjoyed some of the region's highest levels of female literacy and workforce engagement. But after Saddam Hussein's 1990 invasion of Kuwait, when women's rights were subverted in an attempt to gain clerical support for the Baathist regime, female literacy plunged from 75 percent to less than 25 percent. Nor do all of Coleman's Islamic feminists succeed; some are killed or forced into exile, and even the successful ones have little hope of eradicating the ""strain of nihilism running on the fringes of Islam today."" Some grudgingly view the marriage of Islam and feminism as one of convenience, and they despair of achieving true equality in a religious context. Still, Coleman believes the Middle East's small but persistent streams of female activists are more likely to swell than to subside, and that with time they have the capacity to erode the barriers that have held them and their countries back.

Twentieth-century West-leaning modernizers such as  bluntly denounced the veil without acknowledging its complex effect on society, while current politicians seek legitimacy by catering to anti-Western religious conservatives and sacrificing women's rights along the way. ""Islamic feminism"" can be a loaded term among those who see feminism as an illegitimate Western import. But according to , reform within an Islamic framework is the most promising avenue toward women's advancement. She introduces us to Muslims, both religious and secular, who engage in ijtihad, ""the process of arriving at new interpretations of Islamic law through critical reasoning, rather than blindly following the views of past scholars."" They use the Koran to show that gender inequality isn't an Islamic concept so much as a cultural one, and that extreme practices against women represent ""a subversion of Islamic teaching, its corruption by tribal customs and traditions."" Traditional societies do not tend to tolerate change imposed from the top, however, and turning ijtihad into action requires delicate maneuvering by insiders who can work with mullahs and politicians and resist the urge to superimpose Western-style feminism on Eastern societies. ""I don't want to criticize the work of foreigners,"" says , an Afghan woman  meets who runs a women's health and education nonprofit, ""but when they come here and start teaching the women about their rights, the women often go home and criticize their husbands and their life just gets worse. We are helping the women learn how to negotiate with their husbands. The Quran is most helpful for that."" 's feminists use modern technology to promote their message: Advocacy groups bombard policymakers with e-mail, and activists use  to broadcast abuses captured on cellphone videos.

Nor do all of 's Islamic feminists succeed; some are killed or forced into exile, and even the successful ones have little hope of eradicating the ""strain of nihilism running on the fringes of Islam today."" Some grudgingly view the marriage of Islam and feminism as one of convenience, and they despair of achieving true equality in a religious context.

Rage and Rebellion Across the Islamic World By Robin Wright 307 pp. Simon & Schuster. $26.99. The Arab world is poised for an era of political and cultural renewal. In dramatic succession, popular uprisings have toppled long-reigning dictators even as others cling to power. Amid these momentous events, scholars, journalists and politicians are scrambling to explain how these revolutions came about after years of political stagnation and dashed attempts at reform. Robin Wright's ''Rock the Casbah,'' though it was mainly reported before this year's convulsions, tackles these questions directly. Wright, a veteran foreign correspondent, argues that the Arab world's younger generation is at the vanguard of a sweeping and seductive cultural revolution. Setting out to challenge the lazy trope that Islam is incompatible with modernity and democracy, she traveled across the Middle East -- with forays into the wider Muslim world -- to profile hip-hop artists, poets, playwrights, feminists, human rights activists, TV imams, comic book creators and comedians. Wright contends that these reformers are working toward a ''counter-jihad'' to reclaim Islam from militants who crave perpetual holy war. ''For the majority of Muslims today, the central issue is not a clash with other civilizations. It is instead a struggle within the faith itself to rescue Islam's central values from a small but virulent minority,'' she writes. ''The new confrontation is effectively a jihad against the Jihad.'' Wright's protagonists include relatively well-known activists like the American Muslim comedians who formed the ''Axis of Evil'' comedy tour, the Islamic scholar and feminist Amina Wadud (who led Friday prayers at mosques in South Africa and New York) and Saudi clerics who developed a government-backed program to de-radicalize Islamic militants. But her best subjects are those who have not been profiled before, like Dalia Ziada, a 29-year-old Egyptian blogger and human rights activist who at the age of 8 underwent female genital mutilation (a practice that, as Wright points out, dates back to the age of the pharaohs in Egypt, long before Islam). Ziada, who is devout and wears the Islamic head scarf, started a blog in 2006 and joined a burgeoning movement nicknamed the ''pink hijabis'' -- observant Muslim women campaigning against domestic violence, female genital mutilation and other social problems rooted in misogynistic interpretations of Islam. Inspired by a comic book called ''The Montgomery Story,'' about the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s Walk to Freedom, Ziada translated it into Arabic. ''When I read this story, I learned that someone must take the risk for others to follow,'' she told Wright. ''I wanted to be the Martin Luther King of Egypt!'' In 2008, she helped organize a film festival devoted to human rights -- and eluded government censors by screening the films on a riverboat that cruised the waters of the Nile. In early 2011, Ziada joined the hundreds of thousands of Egyptians protesting in Tahrir Square, who toppled the regime of President Hosni Mubarak after its 30 years in power. Wright also recounts the tale of Hissa Hilal, an amateur Saudi poet and mother of four who appeared on a reality TV show in Abu Dhabi called ''Poet of Millions'' (imagine ''American Idol,'' but in verse, with the winner collecting a prize of over $1 million). Normally, contestants on these shows pad their poems with grandiose invocations of a proud Bedouin past and the romance of the desert. But Hilal, wearing the enveloping black niqab, with only two slits for her eyes, read a poem titled ''The Chaos of Fatwas'' -- an attack on Islamic militants and established clerics for their many religious rulings that incite violence. ''Extremist fatwas represent subversive thinking, terrifying thinking,'' she told Wright, ''and everyone should stand against them.'' By doing so, Hilal became the first woman to reach the show's final round; she also received multiple death threats. While her portraits are often inspiring, Wright ultimately skirts the question of whether these few brave individuals represent a significant political and social force within Islam. The reader walks away thinking that since the Sept. 11 attacks, a battle has been waged between a minority of Islamic extremists like Al /Qaeda and the majority of Muslims, who are now ''fighting back'' -- in cool, creative cultural ways -- to reclaim Islam. Wright rests much of her argument on sweeping assertions culled from the characters she profiles and supplemented by public opinion polls. ''A growing number of Muslims now want to use their faith as a means to an end, rather than an end in itself -- or as a way to find answers rather than being the answer itself,'' she writes. ''For them, Islam is often more about identity than piety, about Muslim values rather than Islamic ideology. Islam is a comfortable space and a legitimate vehicle to search for solutions compatible with global trends; it is no longer about creating an ideal Islamic state or even voting for Islamic parties.'' This is a radical claim, but it's largely unsubstantiated. In the past, when given free electoral choices, Arabs have voted in large numbers -- and they have voted for Islamist parties, as they did in Iraq in 2005 (and again in 2010) and for Hamas during the Palestinian parliamentary elections in 2006. By concentrating so closely on cultural reformers, Wright fails to address the place of Islamist movements like Hamas, Hez/bollah, the Muslim Brotherhood and the supporters of the Iraqi Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr. There's hardly any mention of these quite popular groups, let alone how they relate to her notion of the ''counter-jihad'' and where they might fit into the post-revolutionary order in the region. Hezbollah and Hamas, in particular, offer a mixture of Islamist ideology and 20th-century national liberation rhetoric. These movements could be strengthened by the regional upheavals, precisely because they combine Islamic and nationalist narratives. Right now, they are in a bind because of their reliance on (and, in Hezbollah's case, support for) repressive regimes in Syria and Iran. But unlike Al Qaeda, which has no realistic political platform and whose main objective is to kill civilians, these groups have carefully defined goals underpinned by the notion of ''national resistance'' against Israel. They also have an important social base, provide social services to their constituents and participate in electoral politics. Wright, it seems, has taken promising developments on the ground -- developments that appeal to the American romance with youth, technology and agency -- and read too much into them, perhaps in a wishful projection of American ideals. This comes from good intentions: she wants American readers to relate to Muslims, to think ''they're just like us.'' But a less encouraging reading is that the Muslims who are ''just like us'' -- the most Westernized -- tend to be the least representative and least effective in bringing about deep cultural shifts. In the end, her inspirational portraits do not support her claim that ''the counter-jihad is the most pivotal trend in the Islamic world.'' Part of the problem is that Wright presents these debates in an ahistorical void, as if they had only just now begun. She portrays those working to revolutionize Islam as reformers driven by their response to the terrorist attacks of 9/11 and subsequent American occupations of Afghanistan and Iraq. But while recent events clearly galvanized some of the characters she profiles, the effort to reform Islam stretches back for centuries -- and it has been influenced by secular ideals. Wright's characters, while they are pious, are also the modern inheritors of an Arab secular and nationalist awakening that first stirred in the 19th century. The outcome of today's revolts will depend as much on how the Arab world revises its secular traditions as on debates within Islam. The contemporary debates on Islam, modernity and nationalism began with two 19th-century scholars, Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and Muhammad Abduh, who taught at Al-Azhar University in Cairo, the seat of Sunni learning. Afghani argued that Muslims needed a new interpretation of the Koran suited to modern times, and he sought to impose limits on the powers of Muslim rulers with constitutions based on updated Islamic principles. Other reformers debated the merits of constitutional government and tried to establish elected assemblies. The subsequent Arab nahda, or renaissance, was a period of literary and intellectual innovation when Arabs living under the rule of the Ottoman Empire rediscovered their storied past. Beirut and Cairo emerged as centers of publishing and journalism, as intellectuals produced new works and republished classics of Arab literature and political thought. This renaissance laid the groundwork for the Arab nationalism that would dominate the 20th century; it sowed the idea that Arabs are bound by a common language, culture and history. Eventually, of course, Arab nationalism led to dictatorship and disillusionment -- and its appeal waned after the humiliating Arab defeat in the 1967 war with Israel. By the 1980s, Islamist movements were growing and autocratic rulers were building elaborate security apparatuses to keep the Islamists and secular opponents from gaining any political power. Even if they don't know it, Wright's characters owe a great deal to the secular thinkers who challenged religious orthodoxy and secular strongmen alike in the years that followed the 1967 war. Among these is the Syrian philosopher Sadik al-Azm, whose ''Self-Criticism After the Defeat'' was published in 1968: it disputed the dominant Arab narrative that the defeat was due only to outside forces of imperialism and colonialism. He argued that Arab societies needed to modernize by embracing democracy, scientific innovation and gender equality -- all themes echoed by Wright's modern-day activists. A year before his assassination in June 2005, the Lebanese journalist Samir Kassir published a powerful short book in French (later issued in English as ''Being Arab'') exploring the roots of what he called the ''Arab malaise'' of the early 21st century. Kassir contrasted this malaise with two historic periods of Arab cultural and political ascendancy: the nahda and the age of early Islamic empires in the seventh to 12th centuries, when Arabs were the dominant power in the world. That era is particularly significant for Islamists, who pine for the early days of Islam when its imperial ambitions were at their height. But Kassir argued that the Arab world must move beyond this nostalgia to see the 19th-century renaissance as a more realistic model for ending Arab frustration. He described the nahda as an era ''when Arabs could look to the future with optimism.'' For a long time, that sense of possibility seemed out of reach. But the Arab revolts of 2011 are the start of a new journey of reform and renewal. The secular and nationalist visions articulated by Azm, Kassir and others are still alive; but so are the Islamist agendas of the Muslim Brotherhood, Hezbollah and Hamas. Indeed, the current Arab revolts are partly driven by Islamist aspirations, but also by a renewed notion of Pan-Arab identity. Arabs are inspired by one another's methods and ambitions, as the protests that began in Tunisia spread to Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Bahrain and Syria. Of course, today's revolutionaries are trying to dislodge the rulers who came to power during the last wave of Arab nationalist fervor. Through her profiles, Wright chronicles a sliver of this longstanding battle between reform and orthodoxy. The larger struggle is still playing out on the streets of Cairo, Tunis, Tripoli, Damascus and elsewhere. Like the history itself, that narrative has yet to be written."," is a journalism professor at  and an adjunct senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations.

"NYT",2001,"France","FILM; The Joy of a Comeback That Leaves the Past Behind","CHARLOTTE RAMPLING'S screen image in the late 1960's and early 1970's was so strong that for many moviegoers she remains fixed as the seductive and disturbing young woman who haunts, say, ""The Damned"" or ""Night Porter."" In practice, of course, her life kept going: two marriages, two children and 40 more movies, many made in France, her home for the last 30 years. Yet the star she had been still shadowed her. Even her enduring beauty evoked that other younger woman, that earlier more celebrated career. Now, however, in one of those moments savored by every lifelong actor, Ms. Rampling is enjoying a comeback. Along with accolades for her moving portrayal of bereavement in Francois Ozon's ""Under the Sand,"" this winter she received an honorary Cesar, a French Oscar, for her career. The noted movie magazine, Cahiers du Cinema, devoted a cover story to her. And at next month's Cannes International Film Festival, she will be the host for the opening ceremony on May 9 and the awards ceremony on May 20, both being televised nationwide here. Overnight, it seems, she is again a star, but this time as the mature actress of 55 that she has become. Her response to all this is perhaps one expected of an Englishwoman raised by a strict military father in a tradition of no boasting, no drawing attention to oneself, no making a fuss. ""As you go through life, there are cycles you have to live through,"" she said in an interview in her simply furnished Left Bank apartment. ""There is so much apprenticeship about life that quite a lot of the time you're walking in mud. Everything seems to go wrong, but you keep on walking because you have to survive. Then there is a moment when things come together, as if by magic, though it's not magic, it's mostly hard work. And this is the period I am in."" Still, if Ms. Rampling felt ready for a new cycle, ""Under the Sand,"" which opens Friday in New York, was a fortuitous catalyst. Indeed, it was a movie that was almost not made. Even with Ms. Rampling on board, Mr. Ozon could afford to make only the first 20 minutes of the film, which potential French backers thought too depressing. Ms. Rampling stuck with the project, however, and, five months later, after attracting investment from outside France, it was completed. ""I thought, 'Two people will see this,' "" she said with a laugh. ""I never know about films I'm in. I'm a complete idiot. It took me a long time to realize people were being affected by this film. Perhaps it's just being defensive. You become distrustful. You shield yourself against rejection. You say: 'O.K., it doesn't matter. I'll do another film anyway.' "" The movie's first 20 minutes are almost provocatively uneventful, with Marie Drillon (Ms. Rampling) and her husband, Jean (Bruno Cramer), arriving at their vacation home in southwest France, preparing supper and going to bed. The following morning, at an empty beach, Jean rubs oil into Marie's back, then suggests they go swimming. She prefers to doze, but when she awakens Jean has vanished. She calls in rescue teams. No sign of Jean. Has he run away from her? Has he drowned? Did he commit suicide? During the break in filming, working closely with Ms. Rampling, Mr. Ozon and three collaborators fleshed out a story that focuses on the process of mourning, in this case one that leads Marie to a bizarre form of denial that enables her to have an affair with Vincent (Jacques Nolot) at the same time she hallucinates that Jean is watching or talking to her. Her close friend Amanda (Alexandra Stewart) struggles to pull her back to reality, but Marie cannot face the different reality that Jean has died and may even have killed himself. If this 95-minute French-language film had been made in English in Hollywood, it would be called a vehicle for Ms. Rampling, since it revolves entirely around Marie's painful journey, a journey that Mr. Ozon traces through Ms. Rampling's youthful (and briefly naked) body, her intense and expressive face and, above all, her remarkable eyes. And yet it is not a sad story: through love and determination as well as melancholy and confusion, Ms. Rampling records Marie's fight for her own life in the shadow of Jean's mysterious disappearance. Released in France in February, the film has been a success both at the box office (a healthy 600,000 spectators to date) and among critics, who praised it as a worthy successor to Mr. Ozon's last movie, ""Water Drops on Burning Rocks,"" a four-way erotic power game that A. O. Scott described in The New York Times last year as ""a brilliant satire of emotional politics."" Almost inevitably, though, French critics singled out Ms. Rampling's performance. ""Through her desire and through her body, Ms. Rampling becomes the halo of light that shines through this film and gives it life,"" Jacques Mandelbaum wrote in Le Monde. In Liberation, Didier Peron described her as this ""ascetic and icy actress"" who ""effortlessly transforms the steadiness of her gaze or the purity of her laugh into total disorder."" And in Le Figaro, Dominique Borde said he followed the story on Ms. Rampling's face, ""unhappiness playing on her wrinkles, her lips tightened with reserve, her eyes looking away, perhaps into herself."" If such controlled passion requires the tapping of hidden emotions, Ms. Rampling's resources are ample, collected as much through her movie experience as through the wounds inflicted on her by life. She remembers having a ""miserable"" childhood followed by a wild time between ages 16 and 20 as a swinging Londoner and, thanks to her role in Silvio Narizzano's ""Georgy Girl"" (1966), as a sexy new starlet. Then, on the eve of Ms. Rampling's 21st birthday, her older sister, Sarah, died of a brain hemorrhage, and suddenly her career changed direction. ""My whole life fell apart because Mum fell apart, everybody fell apart, life was 180 degrees different,"" she recalled. ""The roles of coltish jolly girls suddenly made no sense for me. I couldn't be in films for entertainment. I had to be in films for another reason if I was to carry on making films. Everything was going right out of the window, and I wanted to go right into the darkness. To be able to exorcise your demons, you have to go into the darkness."" It was a journey that led her to play a German industrialist's wife during the rise of Nazism in Luchino Visconti's ""Damned"" (1969) and to an even darker role in Liliana Cavani's ""Night Porter"" (1974). Here she played a concentration camp survivor who resumes a sado-masochistic relationship in postwar Vienna with her former Nazi captor. Other memorable roles followed -- in Dick Richards's ""Farewell, My Lovely"" (1975), Woody Allen's ""Stardust Memories"" (1980) and Sidney Lumet's ""Verdict"" (1982). ""We all have loads of emotional information,"" Mr. Rampling explained. ""What an actor does is bring it to the surface. I jump without a net because that's how I am. The information comes out because I am brave enough to allow it. I'm not brave as a human being in everyday life. I'm brave when I'm acting."" In the early 1970's, Ms. Rampling and her first husband and then manager, Bryan Southcombe, moved to the South of France to escape punishing British taxes. They had one son, but their marriage fell apart after she met the French composer Jean-Michel Jarre in 1974. They, too, had a son and separated in the mid-1990's. By then, Ms. Rampling's career was drifting. She only made films that interested her, refusing to work just for money, as she put it, but they went largely unnoticed. And even before her marriage broke up, she fell into a depression that required lengthy treatment. ""I talk about it openly because it is an integral part of my life,"" she said with typical frankness. ""But I don't really know what it was about. It's not to do with Jean-Michel or my work or break-ups of any sort, but it's probably to do with all of that because it's about grief, separation, about such megapain you feel as a child and can't come to terms with. And you carry this stuff until in the end you can't carry it anymore."" When she now talks of emerging from a cycle of life, then, she also means recovering her health, finding love again with a French businessman and renewing her desire to work. Her last film, Jonathan Nossiter's ""Signs and Wonders,"" which received mixed reviews in the United States when it opened in February, already raised her spirits, even though she plays a woman whose husband (Stellan Skarsgard) leaves her for a younger woman, a rejection that she herself had experienced with Mr. Jarre. Mr. Nossiter was in turn thrilled to work with her. ""She has accumulated all this experience, good and bad, but she has the grace not to dump it on us in a self-indulgent way,"" Mr. Nossiter said in a telephone interview from San Francisco. ""She brings everything she is feeling and exchanges it with you, with the other actors, with everyone. She is not playing acting, she is trying to live. Her human presence transcends the character she plays."" As with Mr. Nossiter, Ms. Rampling said she responded to Mr. Ozon almost instinctively. She had seen and admired his 1997 film, ""Regarde la Mer"" (""See the Sea""), and she liked the simple idea behind ""Under the Sand."" Mr. Ozon, 34, said that in looking for an actress in her 50's who was willing to be filmed ""without artifice,"" he was drawn by Ms. Rampling's image of ""being a bit subversive."" Then, after they met, he said, ""we understood each other immediately."" Since making ""Under the Sand,"" Ms. Rampling has been busy. In Hans Petter Moland's decidedly dark ""Aberdeen,"" which opens in New York in July, she plays a woman dying of cancer as she awaits the return of her estranged alcoholic husband (Mr. Skarsgard). In John Irvin's ""Fourth Angel,"" she plays opposite Jeremy Irons as a British secret service agent investigating a suspicious bombing. And in Kenneth Hope's ""Superstition,"" she portrays an English nun and psychiatrist investigating whether a suspected arsonist is a witch or a murderess. ""God knows what I'm doing as a nun,"" she exclaimed with a loud giggle. Ms. Rampling is clearly enjoying herself again. Even if her screen image has often been chilly and intimidating, her private persona has always been warm and friendly. Now, heralded by ""Under the Sand,"" her comeback has added a spring to her walk. ""The meeting of a role and an actor happened in 'Night Porter,' and it happened again here,"" Mr. Ozon said. ""But this is now Charlotte in her 50's, and the public likes an actress who shows herself like anyone else, without makeup, without a face lift. In the past, she was rather distant. Now everyone can identify with her.""","CHARLOTTE RAMPLING'S screen image in the late 1960's and early 1970's was so strong that for many moviegoers she remains fixed as the seductive and disturbing young woman who haunts, say, ""The Damned"" or ""Night Porter."" In practice, of course, her life kept going: two marriages, two children and 40 more movies, many made in , her home for the last 30 years. Yet the star she had been still shadowed her. Even her enduring beauty evoked that other younger woman, that earlier more celebrated career. Now, however, in one of those moments savored by every lifelong actor,  is enjoying a comeback. Along with accolades for her moving portrayal of bereavement in 's ""Under the Sand,"" this winter she received an honorary , a French Oscar, for her career. The noted movie magazine, Cahiers du Cinema, devoted a cover story to her. And at next month's , she will be the host for the opening ceremony on May 9 and the awards ceremony on May 20, both being televised nationwide here. Overnight, it seems, she is again a star, but this time as the mature actress of 55 that she has become. Her response to all this is perhaps one expected of an Englishwoman raised by a strict military father in a tradition of no boasting, no drawing attention to oneself, no making a fuss. ""As you go through life, there are cycles you have to live through,"" she said in an interview in her simply furnished Left Bank apartment. ""There is so much apprenticeship about life that quite a lot of the time you're walking in mud. Everything seems to go wrong, but you keep on walking because you have to survive. Then there is a moment when things come together, as if by magic, though it's not magic, it's mostly hard work. And this is the period I am in."" Still, if  felt ready for a new cycle, ""Under the Sand,"" which opens Friday in , was a fortuitous catalyst. Indeed, it was a movie that was almost not made. Even with  on board, Mr.  could afford to make only the first 20 minutes of the film, which potential French backers thought too depressing.  stuck with the project, however, and, five months later, after attracting investment from outside , it was completed. ""I thought, 'Two people will see this,' "" she said with a laugh. ""I never know about films I'm in. I'm a complete idiot. It took me a long time to realize people were being affected by this film. Perhaps it's just being defensive. You become distrustful. You shield yourself against rejection. You say: 'O.K., it doesn't matter. I'll do another film anyway.' "" The movie's first 20 minutes are almost provocatively uneventful, with  () and her husband,  (), arriving at their vacation home in southwest , preparing supper and going to bed. The following morning, at an empty beach,  rubs oil into 's back, then suggests they go swimming. She prefers to doze, but when she awakens  has vanished. She calls in rescue teams. No sign of . Has he run away from her? Has he drowned? Did he commit suicide? During the break in filming, working closely with , Mr.  and three collaborators fleshed out a story that focuses on the process of mourning, in this case one that leads  to a bizarre form of denial that enables her to have an affair with  () at the same time she hallucinates that  is watching or talking to her. Her close friend  () struggles to pull her back to reality, but  cannot face the different reality that  has died and may even have killed himself. If this 95-minute French-language film had been made in English in , it would be called a vehicle for , since it revolves entirely around 's painful journey, a journey that Mr.  traces through 's youthful (and briefly naked) body, her intense and expressive face and, above all, her remarkable eyes. And yet it is not a sad story: through love and determination as well as melancholy and confusion,  records 's fight for her own life in the shadow of 's mysterious disappearance. Released in  in February, the film has been a success both at the box office (a healthy 600,000 spectators to date) and among critics, who praised it as a worthy successor to Mr. 's last movie, ""Water Drops on Burning Rocks,"" a four-way erotic power game that  described in  last year as ""a brilliant satire of emotional politics."" Almost inevitably, though, French critics singled out 's performance. ""Through her desire and through her body,  becomes the halo of light that shines through this film and gives it life,""  wrote in . In Liberation,  described her as this ""ascetic and icy actress"" who ""effortlessly transforms the steadiness of her gaze or the purity of her laugh into total disorder."" And in ,  said he followed the story on 's face, ""unhappiness playing on her wrinkles, her lips tightened with reserve, her eyes looking away, perhaps into herself."" If such controlled passion requires the tapping of hidden emotions, 's resources are ample, collected as much through her movie experience as through the wounds inflicted on her by life. She remembers having a ""miserable"" childhood followed by a wild time between ages 16 and 20 as a swinging Londoner and, thanks to her role in 's ""Georgy Girl"" (1966), as a sexy new starlet. Then, on the eve of 's 21st birthday, her older sister, , died of a brain hemorrhage, and suddenly her career changed direction. ""My whole life fell apart because Mum fell apart, everybody fell apart, life was 180 degrees different,"" she recalled. ""The roles of coltish jolly girls suddenly made no sense for me. I couldn't be in films for entertainment. I had to be in films for another reason if I was to carry on making films. Everything was going right out of the window, and I wanted to go right into the darkness. To be able to exorcise your demons, you have to go into the darkness."" It was a journey that led her to play a German industrialist's wife during the rise of Nazism in 's ""Damned"" (1969) and to an even darker role in 's ""Night Porter"" (1974). Here she played a concentration camp survivor who resumes a sado-masochistic relationship in postwar  with her former Nazi captor. Other memorable roles followed -- in 's ""Farewell, My Lovely"" (1975), 's ""Stardust Memories"" (1980) and 's ""Verdict"" (1982). ""We all have loads of emotional information,"" Mr.  explained. ""What an actor does is bring it to the surface. I jump without a net because that's how I am. The information comes out because I am brave enough to allow it. I'm not brave as a human being in everyday life. I'm brave when I'm acting."" In the early 1970's,  and her first husband and then manager, , moved to the South of  to escape punishing British taxes. They had one son, but their marriage fell apart after she met the French composer -Michel  in 1974. They, too, had a son and separated in the mid-1990's. By then, 's career was drifting. She only made films that interested her, refusing to work just for money, as she put it, but they went largely unnoticed. And even before her marriage broke up, she fell into a depression that required lengthy treatment. ""I talk about it openly because it is an integral part of my life,"" she said with typical frankness. ""But I don't really know what it was about. It's not to do with -Michel or my work or break-ups of any sort, but it's probably to do with all of that because it's about grief, separation, about such megapain you feel as a child and can't come to terms with. And you carry this stuff until in the end you can't carry it anymore."" When she now talks of emerging from a cycle of life, then, she also means recovering her health, finding love again with a French businessman and renewing her desire to work. Her last film, Jonathan 's ""Signs and Wonders,"" which received mixed reviews in the  when it opened in February, already raised her spirits, even though she plays a woman whose husband (Stellan Skarsgard) leaves her for a younger woman, a rejection that she herself had experienced with Mr. . Mr.  was in turn thrilled to work with her. ""She has accumulated all this experience, good and bad, but she has the grace not to dump it on us in a self-indulgent way,"" Mr.  said in a telephone interview from . ""She brings everything she is feeling and exchanges it with you, with the other actors, with everyone. She is not playing acting, she is trying to live. Her human presence transcends the character she plays."" As with Mr. ,  said she responded to Mr.  almost instinctively. She had seen and admired his 1997 film, ""Regarde la Mer"" (""See the Sea""), and she liked the simple idea behind ""Under the Sand.""

"NYT",2011,"Afghanistan","For Afghan Woman, Justice Runs Into Unforgiving Wall of Custom","KABUL, Afghanistan -- When the Afghan government announced Thursday that it would pardon a woman who had been imprisoned for adultery after she reported that she had been raped, the decision seemed a clear victory for the many women here whose lives have been ground down by the Afghan justice system. But when the announcement also made it clear that there was an expectation that the woman, Gulnaz, would agree to marry the man who raped her, the moment instead revealed the ways in which even efforts guided by the best intentions to redress violence against women here run up against the limits of change in a society where cultural practices are so powerful that few can resist them, not even the president. The solution holds grave risks for Gulnaz, who uses one name, since the man could be so humiliated that he might kill his accuser, despite the risk of prosecution, or abuse her again. The decision from the government of President Hamid Karzai is all the more poignant coming as Western forces prepare to leave Afghanistan, underscoring the unfinished business of advancing women's rights here, and raising questions of what will happen in the future to other women like Gulnaz. Indeed, what prompted the government to act at all was a grass-roots movement that began after Gulnaz was featured in a recent documentary film commissioned by the European Union, which then blocked the film's release. Supporters of the filmmakers charged that European officials were shying away from exposing the sort of abuses Afghan women routinely suffer for fear of offending their host government. While Gulnaz's pardon is a victory for both Clementine Malpas, a filmmaker who spent nearly six months on the documentary, and for Kimberley Motley, an American lawyer here who took Gulnaz's case on a pro bono basis, it also shows that for women in the justice system, the odds are stacked against them. The banned film, ''In-Justice: The Story of Afghan Women in Jail,'' which was seen by The New York Times, profiles three Afghan women who were in prison. One was Gulnaz, then about 19, who gave birth to the child of her rapist in prison, after initially being sentenced to three years. In a second trial, her sentence was increased to 12 years, but a judge on camera offered her a way out: marry her rapist. A second woman in the film was abused by her husband and ran away with a man she fell in love with; both are now in prison for adultery. The third woman was a child of 14, who appeared to have been kidnapped but was held as a runaway and has since been returned to her family. After the film was completed, the European Union banned its release, effectively silencing the women who were willing to tell their stories. The reason given for the ban was that the publicity could harm the women, because an Afghan woman who has had sex out of wedlock can easily become the victim of a so-called honor killing. The women had not given their written consent to be in the film, said Vygaudas Usackas, the European Union's ambassador to Afghanistan. But an e-mail obtained by The Times from someone supportive of the filmmakers suggested that the European Union also had political reasons for the ban. The e-mail addressed to the filmmakers by the European Union attache for justice, the rule of law and human rights, Zoe Leffler, said the European Union ''also has to consider its relations with the justice institutions in connection with the other work that it is doing in the sector.'' Even if the women in the film ''were to give their full consent,'' the European Union would not be '' willing to take responsibility for the events that could ensue and that could threaten the lives of the documentary's subjects,'' the e-mail said. Mr. Usackas said that concern for the women was central in the European Union's decision. ''Not only does the E.U. care about women, but we have spent over 45 million euros,'' about $60 million, ''in support of different programs for women,'' he said, adding that the European Union also finances shelters for women. Word of the film's suppression percolated through human rights groups here to the point that many in the nascent Afghan women's movement were referring to the victims by name and discussing what would be best for them, given the strictures of Afghan society. Some people circulated a petition urging Gulnaz's release and gathered more than 6,000 signatures, which were delivered to Mr. Karzai. Although human rights advocates came down emphatically on the side of broadcasting the documentary, Afghan women's advocates were more cautious, having been stung by previous cases. In 2010, there was widespread publicity of the case of Bibi Aisha, a Pashtun child bride, whose nose was cut off by her Taliban husband; it backfired. Conservative Afghan leaders started a campaign against the nonprofit women's shelters, one of which had helped Bibi Aisha. They came close to shutting down the shelters, which would have been a huge loss for abused women who have no other refuge. ''When we write or produce articles or movies on Afghan women, no matter how horrible the life of Afghan women is, and we know that is the reality of Afghan women, we want to be very careful not to make the situation worse,'' said Samira Hamidi, country director of the Afghan Women's Network. ''We don't want to block the way for other women who have similar problems and who don't have anyone to help them,'' Ms. Hamidi said. But to not show the plight of Afghan women is to reduce the possibility that the government and the society will ever change. ''It is our position in the human rights community that one of the best ways to highlight a human rights issue is to let the victims speak and to publicize what has happened to them to a wide audience,'' said Georgette Gagnon, an official with the United Nations mission in Afghanistan. The problem for Gulnaz and the other women in the film is the deeply held belief that women uphold their family's honor. Thus any attempt to expose abuse is so humiliating to the family that a woman who speaks out often becomes a pariah among her relatives, ending up isolated as well as abused. Gulnaz's case shows the power of cultural norms. On the one hand, the public campaign for the woman prompted the pardon, which ensures that she will be able to bring up her daughter outside prison. On the other hand, the fact that the only imaginable solution to the situation of a woman with an illegitimate child is to have her marry the father -- even if he is a rapist -- is testament to the rigid belief here that a woman is respectable only if she is embedded within a family. Ms. Malpas said that Gulnaz talked to her about why she felt that she had to give in to requests that she marry the man who raped her, even though she did not want to, explaining that not only would she be an outcast if she did not, but so would her daughter, and she would bring shame on her family. ''Gulnaz said, 'My rapist has destroyed my future,' '' Ms. Malpas said, recounting their conversation. '' 'No one will marry me after what he has done to me. So I must marry my rapist for my child's sake. I don't want people to call her a bastard and abuse my brothers. My brothers won't have honor in our society until he marries me.' '' But, mindful of her safety, Gulnaz also said that if she were to marry her rapist she would demand that he make one of his sisters marry one of her brothers, Ms. Motley, the lawyer, said. This practice, known as ''baad,'' is a tribal way of settling disputes. But in this case it would also be an insurance policy for Gulnaz since her rapist would hesitate to hurt her because his sister would be at the mercy of Gulnaz's brother. Both Ms. Malpas and Ms. Motley said that a shelter had been found for Gulnaz and that they hoped she would go there. But whether such a Western option can prevail over Afghan custom -- and whether Gulnaz will choose it -- is far from clear.",",  -- When the  government announced Thursday that it would pardon a woman who had been imprisoned for adultery after she reported that she had been raped, the decision seemed a clear victory for the many women here whose lives have been ground down by the  justice system.

"NYT",2011,"Germany","For Host Germany, Diversity Is the Goal","Fatmire Bajramaj and her family fled to Germany from Kosovo as Yugoslavia broke apart in conflict in the early 1990s. She began playing soccer as a 6-year-old without her father's knowledge or permission. At first, she played at recess and after school with her older brother. Secretly, she joined a club team, using equipment lent by her brother and cleats borrowed from a teammate that she returned after each practice and game. ''My father wanted me to be a singer or an actress,'' Bajramaj, who is known as Lira, said in a recent telephone interview, speaking through an interpreter. ''He told me that football was for men, not for women.'' Yet today, at 23, Bajramaj (pronounced BUY-rah-mye) is a star midfielder on the German women's national team, the lone Muslim player on a squad that is seeking its third consecutive World Cup title, beginning with Sunday's opening match against Canada before a crowd of 70,000-plus at Berlin's Olympic Stadium. The 16-team tournament, which features the United States and Brazil as the expected top challengers, will end July 17 in Frankfurt. German soccer officials hope the World Cup will provide a marketing boon for the women's game and will also enhance their efforts to promote the country's national sport as a means of social integration. In Germany, a third of all children are born to immigrant families, and the issue of assimilation -- or the lack thereof -- has become an urgent political concern. Building on the success of the 2006 men's World Cup in Germany, German soccer officials said the sport's national federation had spent more than $27 million on a project to encourage integration. The program includes the building of 1,000 small fields, developing a joint arrangement between soccer clubs and 17,000 chosen schools and devising an ambassador campaign featuring star German players like Bajramaj and Mesut Ozil, a midfielder of Turkish descent on the men's team. A parallel program started by a university professor, called Football Without Offsides, encourages girls, most from Turkish, Arabic and Eastern European backgrounds, to play soccer at school at ages 9, 10 and 11 -- sometimes with their mothers playing alongside them. Theo Zwanziger, the president of the German soccer federation, is fond of saying, ''It does not bother the ball who hits it.'' Heike Ullrich, the head of women's soccer in the German federation, said this means: ''Football is for everybody, man, woman, black, white, green, all races, all religions. Everyone should have a chance to come in contact with the ball. It unites people.'' When the Bajramaj family arrived in Germany from Kosovo in 1993 and settled in a refugee center, Lira was 5. She said she felt resentment from some locals as she went to and from kindergarten, hearing taunts like ''gypsies'' and ''go back where you came from.'' At 6, she joined a soccer club in Giesenkirchen, and later played in nearby Monchengladbach. ''I was the only girl,'' Bajramaj said. ''At first, the boys didn't accept me. When they saw I could play football, they decided to play with me. Then they were fighting about which team I should play with.'' Two years after she began playing, Bajramaj said, her father, Ismet, attended a match to watch her older brother, Fatos, and by accident learned that his daughter had also taken up soccer. His response was surprise and acceptance, she said, not disapproval. ''He told me I was very good,'' she said. ''Now he is my biggest supporter.'' In 2007, Bajramaj came on as a late substitute as Germany won the Women's World Cup final over Brazil. A year later, she scored both of Germany's goals in a victory over Japan for the bronze medal at the Beijing Olympics. In 2010, her club team, Turbine Potsdam, won the inaugural European women's Champions League title. ''Playing football is what helped me integrate,'' Bajramaj said. ''First, the language. And later I learned a lot about the culture and the cities. In Germany, I am welcome because I play football. And Muslims can see that even though I'm in football, I'm very religious.'' In addition to Bajramaj, three other players on Germany's Women's World Cup team have immigrant roots from Cameroon, Italy and Romania. Germany also has about 30 female players from immigrant backgrounds on its youth national teams, soccer officials said. A handful of Muslim women also play in Germany's professional league, Bajramaj said. Still, cultural and religious barriers exist. Many Muslim families do not want their daughters playing in shorts, with their arms and legs and heads uncovered. Yet, at the elite level, head scarves that also cover the neck are prohibited by FIFA, soccer's world governing body, for reasons of player safety. The governing body also bans the expression of religious beliefs on uniforms. Three years ago, a German girl was given a red-card expulsion from a youth match for wearing a head scarf, said Ulf Gebken, the founder of Football Without Offsides and a specialist in sport and social integration at Carl von Ossietzky University in Oldenburg, Germany. The German soccer federation was petitioned, and it amended its rules to allow head coverings for lower-level leagues, Gebken said. Ullrich, the head of women's soccer in the federation, said: ''When we get this question, I say to people, 'Just let them play.' If it's not the highest league, it's not a problem.'' Football Without Offsides has expanded to about 300 schools and 80 club teams in 120 German cities, Gebken said. A key element of the program is inviting young girls from immigrant families to play at school with their mothers -- outside the presence of boys. ''We're not going to solve all the problems,'' Gebken said. ''But when we make tournaments of daughters and mothers, the mothers are very happy their daughters are playing football. Then we have a chance. If a girl is a very good swimmer or runner, hardly anyone notices. But if the girl is good in football, the family is proud. The girls will come out and play, and there is the chance for integration and emancipation.'' So far, five Muslim women in their late teens and early 20s have become referees, Gebken said. What is needed, he said, are many more female coaches. Half of the club teams in his program still have male coaches. As of now, most German girls from immigrant families wear the jerseys of their favorite players on the men's national team, not the women's team, Gebken said. Players like Ozil and Sami Khedira, a midfielder with a Tunisian father. At the 2010 men's World Cup in South Africa, 11 of Germany's 23 players came from immigrant backgrounds and the team was widely celebrated for its multiculturalism. ''Last summer, many Turkish people were proud,'' Gebken said. ''If Lira Bajramaj is a star in this World Cup, a lot of people will look at her. This is very good marketing for women's football. Will it help integration? We will see. Maybe girls will start wearing the jerseys of the women's players in Germany.''

''He told me that football was for men, not for women.'' Yet today, at 23,  (pronounced BUY-rah-mye) is a star midfielder on the German women's national team, the lone  player on a squad that is seeking its third consecutive World Cup title, beginning with Sunday's opening match against  before a crowd of 70,000-plus at 's Olympic Stadium. The 16-team tournament, which features the  and  as the expected top challengers, will end July 17 in . German soccer officials hope the World Cup will provide a marketing boon for the women's game and will also enhance their efforts to promote the country's national sport as a means of social integration. In , a third of all children are born to immigrant families, and the issue of assimilation -- or the lack thereof -- has become an urgent political concern. Building on the success of the 2006 men's World Cup in , German soccer officials said the sport's national federation had spent more than $27 million on a project to encourage integration. The program includes the building of 1,000 small fields, developing a joint arrangement between soccer clubs and 17,000 chosen schools and devising an ambassador campaign featuring star German players like  and Mesut , a midfielder of Turkish descent on the men's team. A parallel program started by a university professor, called Football Without Offsides, encourages girls, most from Turkish, Arabic and   backgrounds, to play soccer at school at ages 9, 10 and 11 -- sometimes with their mothers playing alongside them. , the president of the German soccer federation, is fond of saying, ''It does not bother the ball who hits it.'' Heike , the head of women's soccer in the German federation, said this means: ''Football is for everybody, man, woman, black, white, green, all races, all religions. Everyone should have a chance to come in contact with the ball. It unites people.'' When the  family arrived in  from  in 1993 and settled in a refugee center, Lira was 5. She said she felt resentment from some locals as she went to and from kindergarten, hearing taunts like ''gypsies'' and ''go back where you came from.'' At 6, she joined a soccer club in , and later played in nearby Monchengladbach. ''I was the only girl,''  said. ''At first, the boys didn't accept me. When they saw I could play football, they decided to play with me. Then they were fighting about which team I should play with.'' Two years after she began playing,  said, her father, , attended a match to watch her older brother, , and by accident learned that his daughter had also taken up soccer. His response was surprise and acceptance, she said, not disapproval. ''He told me I was very good,'' she said. ''Now he is my biggest supporter.'' In 2007,  came on as a late substitute as  won the Women's World Cup final over . A year later, she scored both of 's goals in a victory over  for the bronze medal at the  Olympics. In 2010, her club team, , won the inaugural  women's Champions League title. ''Playing football is what helped me integrate,''  said. ''First, the language. And later I learned a lot about the culture and the cities. In , I am welcome because I play football. And s can see that even though I'm in football, I'm very religious.'' In addition to , three other players on 's Women's World Cup team have immigrant roots from ,  and .  also has about 30 female players from immigrant backgrounds on its youth national teams, soccer officials said. A handful of  women also play in 's professional league,  said. Still, cultural and religious barriers exist. Many  families do not want their daughters playing in shorts, with their arms and legs and heads uncovered. Yet, at the elite level, head scarves that also cover the neck are prohibited by , soccer's world governing body, for reasons of player safety. The governing body also bans the expression of religious beliefs on uniforms. Three years ago, a German girl was given a red-card expulsion from a youth match for wearing a head scarf, said , the founder of Football Without Offsides and a specialist in sport and social integration at  von  in , . The German soccer federation was petitioned, and it amended its rules to allow head coverings for lower-level leagues,  said. , the head of women's soccer in the federation, said: ''When we get this question, I say to people, 'Just let them play.' If it's not the highest league, it's not a problem.'' Football Without Offsides has expanded to about 300 schools and 80 club teams in 120 German cities,  said. A key element of the program is inviting young girls from immigrant families to play at school with their mothers -- outside the presence of boys. ''We're not going to solve all the problems,''  said. ''But when we make tournaments of daughters and mothers, the mothers are very happy their daughters are playing football. Then we have a chance. If a girl is a very good swimmer or runner, hardly anyone notices. But if the girl is good in football, the family is proud. The girls will come out and play, and there is the chance for integration and emancipation.'' So far, five  women in their late teens and early 20s have become referees,  said. What is needed, he said, are many more female coaches. Half of the club teams in his program still have male coaches. As of now, most German girls from immigrant families wear the jerseys of their favorite players on the men's national team, not the women's team,  said. Players like  and , a midfielder with a  father. At the 2010 men's World Cup in , 11 of 's 23 players came from immigrant backgrounds and the team was widely celebrated for its multiculturalism. ''Last summer, many Turkish people were proud,''  said. ''If  is a star in this World Cup, a lot of people will look at her. This is very good marketing for women's football. Will it help integration? We will see. Maybe girls will start wearing the jerseys of the women's players in .''

"NYT",2010,"France","For Women In France, Dim Outlook On Equality","PARIS -- Could there be anything more French than this workout? Weeks after giving birth, French women are offered a state-paid, extended course of vaginal gymnastics, complete with personal trainer, electric stimulation devices and computer games that reward particularly nimble squeezing. The aim, said Agnes de Marsac, a physiotherapist who runs such sessions: ''Making love again soon and making more babies.'' Perineal therapy is as ubiquitous in France as free nursery schools, generous family allowances, tax deductions for each child, discounts for large families on high-speed trains, and the expectation that after a paid, four-month maternity leave mothers are back in shape -- and back at work. Courtesy of the state, French women seem to have it all: multiple children, a job and, often, a figure to die for. What they don't have is equality: France ranks 46th in the World Economic Forum's 2010 gender equality report, trailing the United States, most of Europe, but also Kazakhstan and Jamaica. Eighty-two percent of French women aged 25-49 work, many of them full-time, but 82 percent of parliamentary seats are occupied by men. French women earn 26 percent less than men but spend twice as much time on domestic tasks. They have the most babies in Europe, but are also the biggest consumers of anti-depressants. A recent 22-country survey by the Pew Research Center summed it up: three in four French people believe men have a better life than women, by far the highest share in any country polled. ''French women are exhausted,'' said Valerie Toranian, editor-in-chief of Elle magazine in France. ''We have the right to do what men do -- as long as we also take care of the children, cook a delicious dinner and look immaculate. We have to be superwoman.'' The birthplace of Simone de Beauvoir and Brigitte Bardot may look Scandinavian in employment statistics, but it remains Latin in attitude. French women appear to worry about being feminine, not feminist, and French men often display a form of gallantry predating the 1789 revolution. Indeed, the liberation of French women can seem almost accidental -- a byproduct of a paternalist state that takes children under its republican wings from toddler age and an obsession with natality rooted in three devastating wars. ''At the origin, family policy wasn't about women, it was about Germany,'' said Genevieve Fraisse, author of several books on gender history. ''French mothers have conditions women elsewhere can only dream of. But stereotypes remain very much intact.'' Or, as the philosopher Bernard-Henri Levy put it: ''France is an old Gallic macho country.'' France crystallizes the paradox facing many women across the developed world in the early 21st century: They have more say over their sexuality (in France birth control and abortion are legal and subsidized), they have overtaken men in education and are catching up in the labor market, but few make it to the top of business or politics. Only one of France's top companies is run by a woman: Anne Lauvergeon is chief executive of the nuclear power giant Areva and mother of two young children. Having those children is relatively easy in France, one reason Paris seems to teem with stylish career women with several offspring. At 31, Fleur Cohen has four children and works full-time as a doctor at a Left Bank hospital. As she drops her youngest at nursery in stilettos and pencil skirt you would never guess that she gave birth only three months ago. Child No. 4 wasn't ''planned,'' Ms. Cohen said, but it doesn't change all that much: Instead of three children, she now takes four on the Metro in the morning and drops them at the public school and subsidized hospital nursery. She joked that children are probably the best way to reduce your tax bill. Irrespective of income, parents get a monthly allowance of 123, or about $170, for two children, 282 for three children and an additional 158 for every child after that. Add to that tax deductions and other benefits, and the Cohens pretty much stopped paying tax after baby No. 3. Across town, Ms. de Marsac snapped on a plastic glove, inserted two fingers between Clara Pflug's legs and told her to think of the wings of a butterfly as she contracted her birth canal muscles. The French state offers mothers 10 one-on-one, half-hour sessions of perineal therapy to prevent post-pregnancy incontinence and organ descent -- and to improve sex. Ten sessions of free abdominal exercises follow; Ms. de Marsac promises Ms. Pflug a ''washboard tummy.'' French women have on average two babies, compared with 1.5 in the European Union overall. Asked by foreign delegations about ''le miracle francais,'' Nadine Morano, the feisty family minister and mother of three, says bluntly: ''We spend the most money and we offer good childcare, it's as simple as that. Our country understood a long time ago that to reconstruct a nation you need children.'' The 1870 defeat by a much more fertile Prussia led to first efforts to encourage childbirth. Then came the losses of World War I. Since 1920, when the gold Medal of the French Family -- to honor mothers of eight or more -- was created, expenditure on pro-breeding policies has blossomed. Last year, 97 billion, or 5.1 percent of gross domestic product -- twice the E.U. average -- went on family, childcare and maternity benefits. Emblematic in this regard are the ''ecoles maternelles,'' free all-day nursery schools set up a century after the French revolution in part, said Michelle Perrot, a historian, to stamp out the lingering influence of the Roman Catholic Church. La Fleche houses the oldest ecole maternelle in France. At 8:30 a.m., parents drop off toddlers as young as two. Classes end at 4:30 p.m. but a free municipal service offers optional childcare until 6:30 p.m. Children are guaranteed a place in ''maternelle'' from the age of three and 99 percent of them attend. Katy de Bresson, a single mother of two, called the enrollment of her son Arthur a ''mini-revolution.'' Free of all childcare costs, she could return to work full-time. ''I am a lot happier and a lot more self-confident since then.'' Working mothers being the norm, Isabelle Nicolas, a nurse whose youngest son, Titouan, is in Arthur's class and who quit work after his birth, feels pressure to return. ''I spend a lot of time justifying myself,'' she said. ''In France you are expected to do it all.'' But ask any mother here whether school had changed the life of her husband and the answer is ''non.'' ''The school is called 'maternelle' for a reason,'' said principal Anne Leguen. ''In France, children are still considered to be the responsibility of mothers.'' Forty percent of French mothers undergo a career change within a year of giving birth, compared with 6 percent of men. Both parents have the right to take time off or reduce their hours until the child turns three -- but 97 percent of those who do are women. Women spend on average five hours and one minute per day on childcare and domestic tasks, while men spend two hours and seven minutes, according to the national statistics office Insee. In Paris, Ms. Cohen's husband is a doctor, too. But she bathes all four children, cooks and does the Saturday shopping -- largely, she insists, by choice. ''If I didn't prepare food for my children, I would feel less like a mother,'' she said. At work, meanwhile, she plays down motherhood. She sneaks down to the hospital nursery to nurse her baby son, and tries to stay longer than her male colleagues in the evenings. Otherwise, ''everyone will just assume that I'm leaving because of my children and that I am not committed to the job.'' A majority of medical graduates in France are female. Yet all 11 department heads in her hospital are men. ''French men have always been slow to give up power,'' said Jean-Francois Cope, parliamentary leader of President Nicolas Sarkozy's center-right party, who is defending a bill to oblige companies to fill 40 percent of boardroom seats with women. The French Republic made ''equality'' a founding principle, but women were allowed to vote for the first time only in 1945. Since a 1998 law obliged political parties to have an equal number of men and women candidates on their party lists, parties have tended to pay fines rather than comply. Women leaders come under close scrutiny in what is after all the home of couture. Ms. Morano recalls being mocked on television for wearing the same jacket several times. Ms. Lauvergeon likened her outfit to ''armor.'' Four pieces of equal pay legislation have passed since 1972. But in 2009, even childless women in their forties still earned 17 percent less than men. ''A patriarchal corporate culture,'' is the main barrier facing women in French companies, according to Brigitte Gresy, author of a 2009 report on gender equality in the workplace. France is Latin not just in its culture of seduction, but also in its late work hours, Ms. Gresy said. And the disproportional weight of a small number of male-dominated engineering schools in grooming the elites has done its part in excluding women from power. Xavier Michel, president of Ecole Polytechnique, points out that the number of female students has risen tenfold from seven to 70 since he graduated in 1972 -- but that leaves it at just 14 percent. Simone Veil was 18 when French women first voted and 28 when she was allowed to open her own bank account. At 38, as health minister, she pushed through the legalization of abortion. ''A lot has changed, but a lot hasn't,'' she says today. More comfort to her than many of the laws in recent years is the fact that more fathers push strollers through her neighborhood. Ms. Fraisse, the philosopher, says more than two centuries after France got rid of the king as the father of the nation, it needs to get rid of the father as the king of the family. ''We had one revolution,'' she said, ''now we need another one -- in the family.'' This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print."," -- Could there be anything more  than this workout?

"NYT",1990,"France","French Seek Niche With Trump Site","Annoucing that it would open its first American outpost in Trump Tower in Manhattan, Galeries Lafayette, France's largest department store, said it would specialize in women's clothes made in Europe in an effort to succeed in a neighborhood that contains some of the world's most fashionable retailers. Georges Meyer, chairman and general manager of Galeries Lafayette, said at a news conference yesterday that the new store would have higher-priced, more fashionable goods than most of the stores it has in Europe and East Asia. Although retailers had assumed that the New York store would include home furnishings like the European stores, Mr. Meyer said it would specialize solely in women's apparel. At yesterday's announcement, made at Trump Tower, the commercial and residential skyscraper on Fifth Avenue, Mr. Meyer said Galeries Lafayette had signed a 25-year lease for 80,000 square feet of space and planned to open by the fall of 1991. Donald J. Trump, chairman of the Trump Organization, which owns the Trump Tower, was present as well. The income from the lease is expected to help Mr. Trump in his current financial difficulties, which include cash shortages caused by high debt payments. Goods Made in Paris ''In most of our stores we cater to the tourists,'' said the 59-year-old Mr. Meyer, whose family is the major stockholder in the company. ''But here we will cater to New Yorkers with clothes made in France and Europe. It will be a French fashion store with goods made by Parisians, not French fashions made by Americans.'' Saying that ''there are many fine stores in New York,'' he added, ''We know that we have to be different to succeed.'' The new store, which is to be about the size of one and a half football fields and one-tenth the size of Bloomingdale's Manhattan store, will replace Bonwit Teller's flagship store that went out of business earlier this year. Mr. Trump had purchased Bonwit's 12-year lease for $5 million some months ago after the store's parent company, the L. J. Hooker Corporation, filed for voluntary bankruptcy, The new Galeries Lafayette will compete in a retailing area that includes Tiffany & Company, next door; Bergdorf Goodman, diagonally across the street; Henri Bendel, one block to the east, and Saks Fifth Avenue, seven blocks south. But Mr.Meyer played down the competitive risks. involved. ''If it succeeeds, it will be a historic move for us,'' he said, estimating that it would take about two years for the new store to show its mettle. ''If it fails, it will not materially affect our company. We could have purchased an entire chain here if we wanted to, but we didn't. We want to minimize our risk.'' Noting that Galleries Lafayette will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1993, Mr. Meyer said his company's 136 stores under the Galeries and other names had sales of $4 billion last year and net profit margins of about 3 percent. A Base for Profits ''Our profits are O.K. for French retailing but low in American standards,'' he said in English with a heavy accent. He said that he considered the $37 million to $40 million annual sales achieved by the Bonwit Teller store at the site to be ''our base,'' but hoped to do more. Galeries Lafayette, which is Europe's second-largest department store after Harrods in London, had wanted to buy an American retail company for some time. Mr. Meyer, who said he took advantage of the opportunity to open a New York store after Mr. Trump offered the Bonwit lease, said: ''I do not plan an American chain. If there are other opportunities, of course, we will take them.'' But some merchants said the entrance of an international fashion retailer into New York's affluent retailing center might lead to some defections by French designers from their current New York stores. Mr. Meyer said Galeries had ''discovered such designers as Daniel Hechter, Cacherel and Sonia Rykiel.'' But Ira Neimark, chairman of Bergdorf Goodman, said: ''It would be premature to comment on that at this time. We provide an outstanding showcase for American and European designers and will continue to do so.'' The first American Galeries store will represent a step up. Its French stores in Paris, Nice and Toulose are not considered ''a top prestige operator but more middle-of-the road in price, such as Macy,'' said Thomas R. Rauh, director of retailing consulting at Ernst & Young, the New York accounting firm. ''I think they are right to position themselves as a high-end retailer in New York if they want to make it here,'' Mr. Rauh said. When Mr. Meyer was asked if he was concerned that the current slump in United States retailing might present difficulties, for his new venture, he replied that he was not worried. ''In France, our sales are good,'' he said. ''Here, I think that the best retailers are well managed, but are having problems with financing. But I have great respect for them.'' Mr. Meyer said the new store's staff would include a mix of American and French personnel. ''We will hire U.S. people but will probably have a French fashion leader and probably an American general manager,'' he said. Galeries Lafayette's main store, on Boulevard Haussman in Paris, is a huge department store of about 500,000 square feet, which that had sales of $550 million last year. It offers a mix of national brands and designer names along with its own private-label merchandise at what it says are discounts of 30 percent. With a large, airy atrium at its center, the structure is in three parts: A main building specializing in fashion goods for women and children is flanked by a men's store building and a leisure store building. But Galeries Lafayette in New York will not carry as full a line as the Paris store, Mr. Meyer said. ''We will not be able to be different if we carry everything,'' he explained. ''We will have everything in ladies' fashions, but I have not yet decided if we will also have a beauty salon or maybe a gift shop in tableware. We shall see.'' Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about Galeries Lafayette's plan to open a store on 57th Street misstated the location of Henri Bendel. That store is at 10 West 57th Street, just west of the Galeries Lafayette site. The article also misstated the location of Saks Fifth Avenue in some editions. It is at 611 Fifth Avenue, seven blocks south of the site.","Annoucing that it would open its first American outpost in  in , , 's largest department store, said it would specialize in women's clothes made in  in an effort to succeed in a neighborhood that contains some of the world's most fashionable retailers. , chairman and general manager of , said at a news conference yesterday that the new store would have higher-priced, more fashionable goods than most of the stores it has in  and .

''If it fails, it will not materially affect our company. We could have purchased an entire chain here if we wanted to, but we didn't. We want to minimize our risk.'' Noting that Galleries Lafayette will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 1993, Mr.  said his company's 136 stores under the Galeries and other names had sales of $4 billion last year and net profit margins of about 3 percent. A Base for Profits ''Our profits are O.K. for French retailing but low in American standards,'' he said in English with a heavy accent. He said that he considered the $37 million to $40 million annual sales achieved by the  store at the site to be ''our base,'' but hoped to do more. , which is 's second-largest department store after Harrods in , had wanted to buy an American retail company for some time. Mr. , who said he took advantage of the opportunity to open a  store after Mr.  offered the Bonwit lease, said: ''I do not plan an American chain. If there are other opportunities, of course, we will take them.'' But some merchants said the entrance of an international fashion retailer into 's affluent retailing center might lead to some defections by French designers from their current  stores. Mr.  said Galeries had ''discovered such designers as ,  and .'' But , chairman of , said: ''It would be premature to comment on that at this time. We provide an outstanding showcase for American and an designers and will continue to do so.'' The first American Galeries store will represent a step up. Its French stores in ,  and Toulose are not considered ''a top prestige operator but more middle-of-the road in price, such as ,'' said , director of retailing consulting at , the  accounting firm. ''I think they are right to position themselves as a high-end retailer in  if they want to make it here,'' Mr.  said. When Mr.  was asked if he was concerned that the current slump in  retailing might present difficulties, for his new venture, he replied that he was not worried. ''In , our sales are good,'' he said. ''Here, I think that the best retailers are well managed, but are having problems with financing. But I have great respect for them.'' Mr.  said the new store's staff would include a mix of American and French personnel. ''We will hire  people but will probably have a French fashion leader and probably an American general manager,'' he said. 's main store, on  in , is a huge department store of about 500,000 square feet, which that had sales of $550 million last year. It offers a mix of national brands and designer names along with its own private-label merchandise at what it says are discounts of 30 percent. With a large, airy atrium at its center, the structure is in three parts: A main building specializing in fashion goods for women and children is flanked by a men's store building and a leisure store building. But  in  will not carry as full a line as the  store, Mr.  said. ''We will not be able to be different if we carry everything,'' he explained. ''We will have everything in ladies' fashions, but I have not yet decided if we will also have a beauty salon or maybe a gift shop in tableware. We shall see.'' Because of an editing error, an article in Business Day yesterday about 's plan to open a store on 57th Street misstated the location of . That store is at 10 West 57th Street, just west of the  site. The article also misstated the location of  in some editions. It is at 611 Fifth Avenue, seven blocks south of the site."

Body Image Summit Magazine editors and representatives of the British Medical Association gathered in London last week for a meeting the British press called ""the superwaif summit,"" where they discussed whether fashion publications should limit pictures that supposedly encourage eating disorders. The meeting, officially known as the Body Image Summit, was organized by the government's minister for women, Tessa Jowell, in response to a recent report by the medical association declaring that the news media's obsession with skinnness is largely to blame for an escalating number of eating disorders in Britain. Editors from Marie Claire, British Vogue and other magazines agreed to form a committee to monitor images of women in news pages and in advertisements. The group will ostensibly decide how skinny is too skinny, and all will band together to forgo images that might send the wrong message. According to an official transcript of the meeting in the London press, Liz Jones, Marie Claire's editor, said: ""A code of self-regulation would mean if an agency sent us a very thin model whose bones were showing through her skin, we would send her back and write to the agency as well as other magazines telling them not to use her."" Ms. Jones has spoken publicly about her own struggle with eating disorders. Alexandra Shulman, editor of British Vogue, was quoted as endorsing the proposal, but said blame should not fall entirely on the news media.  Glenda Bailey, the founding editor of British Marie Claire and the current editor of the magazine's American edition, acknowledged that ""a code of ethics is very difficult to institute."" Still, the British meeting prompted Ms. Bailey, who put the full-figured Rosie O'Donnell on a cover of Marie Claire, to write a letter last week to Theresa Loar, director of the President's Interagency Council on Women in Washington, suggesting a conference for the United States.

"NYT",1982,"France","GALLIC SHRUG FOR JAPAN'S STYLE","At one time, French designers dictated and dominated what millions of women wore all over the world. Then came the Italians, who gave the French a run for their money. And now, the Japanese. A new way of dressing is emerging from Tokyo. After years of following Western dictates, Japanese designers are proving that they have a mind -and a look - all their own. Their success may be due to the fact that the clothes express a compromise between the traditionalism of their own culture and the aggressive tempo of modern times. At Ready-to-Wear Shows Over the last few years, several Japanese designers have established headquarters in Paris and are now vying with the French in that market. They are represented at the ready-to-wear shows twice a year, and some have opened their own boutiques here, while still retaining their full-fledged, Japan-based operations. There is Kenzo, one of the greatest talents around, whom the French claim as their own, and Hanae Mori, the only Japanese to rank with Parisian high-fashion designers. Mori has her own elegant fashion salon on the Avenue Montaigne, a step away from Dior and Ungaro, and she will be showing with the others two weeks from now. Those two give strength and validity to the growing Japanese design group. 'Very Stimulating' How do French designers react to this Japanese invasion? On the whole, not too badly, even if their comments are often tinged with a dash of arrongance. Emanuel Ungaro does not see this new school of design as a ''Japanese invasion.'' ''They did not exist before,'' he said. ''Now they do. I find this very interesting, very stimulating.'' ''One forgets,'' he added, ''that for centuries, the Japanese had no fashion, only the kimono, which is a wonderful traditional costume, maybe the most beautiful in the world. The Japanese had no need to design anything else. But with the Westernization of Japan, they've had to compete with us.'' Admiration Expressed Ungaro admires the speed and the intelligence of the Japanese designers. Afraid? No, he is not afraid. ''I like talent,'' he said.''I admire people like Issey Miyake, both on a personal and professional level.'' Ungaro does not see any real danger at a designing level. ''Clothes are emotions, instincts,'' he said. But he does sense that the Japanese technical mind might be a threat to the European production system. For Dior's designer Marc Bohan, Japanese design is ''not without interest.'' ''What little I know, I know through 'Women's Wear,' '' he said, ''outside of Kenzo, who has had a tremendous influence. Paris streets are full of girls wearing Kenzo's little ruffled skirts. But outside of Kenzo, I can also see the beginning of interesting, very contemporary Japanese design. Whether or not they will have a longlasting influence on future markets is another story. It's possible because they have a very modern ring. Their clothes are very bare, understated; it's a new way of dressing.'' Asked if he feared the competition of the Japanese, their hard work and their total dedication as well as their budding sense of design, Bohan answered: ''Not at all. It wouldn't be like me at all. Talent knows no frontiers.'' A Note of Surprise Hubert de Givenchy sounded utterly surprised to hear of this new Japanese invasion. ''Honestly,'' he said, ''I haven't noticed, I didn't know about it. But if so, there is no need to worry.  Yesterday, it was the Italians, today the Japanese, tomorrow it might be the Chinese. Why not? After all, we do go to Japan a lot ourselves. All my ready-to-wear is made in Japan and they are remarkable when it comes to technique.'' But Givenchy does not see the Japanese as rivals on a designing level. ''Don't you think,'' he asked ever so politely, ''that they cater to a different clientele? Issey Miyake is charming, has lovely manners; he worked in my house, you know. But their designing has nothing to do with ours. We have nothing to worry about.'' Important Market Yves Saint Laurent himself was unavailable for comment but one knows that Japan is a very important market for him. He has at least 40 licensees in Japan, where his collection was shown in several cities a few months ago. The Seibu department stores also carry Saint Laurent couture and Saint Laurent Rive Gauche ready-to-wear. But although Saint Laurent was locked in, doing his collection, his press representative said she was sure he was not afraid of the Japanese competition. ''Everybody has something to offer,'' she said. ''It's a matter of different talents, different needs.''","At one time, French designers dictated and dominated what millions of women wore all over the world.

"NYT",2010,"Canada","Goalie Stands Tall as Canada Women Take Gold","In the gold medal game on Thursday, the Canadian and American women's hockey teams finally found worthy opponents: each other. But in the end, one woman made the biggest difference. Canada's coach, Melody Davidson, had to choose between the young phenom Shannon Szabados and the veteran Olympian Kim St. Pierre as the starting goalie. She went with youth, and it turned out she made the right choice. Szabados was brilliant, stopping all 28 American shots and enabling Marie-Philip Poulin's two first-period goals to stand up and make Canada the Olympic champion. The 2-0 victory gave Canada its third straight Olympic gold medal. It also came after two consecutive losses to the Americans in major tournament finals, at the world championships in 2008 and 2009. ''At this level you see how deep the goaltending talent is,'' United States defender Kerry Weiland said. ''You get a hot goaltender and it's hard to put it away.'' Canada and the United States are so experienced and so skilled that they are, in the words of Rene Fasel, president of the International Ice Hockey Federation, on a ''different planet'' compared with other women's teams. Both teams cruised through their preliminary games, racking up shutouts and double-digit victories. Even Sweden, which stunned the United States with a semifinal upset at the 2006 Turin Games, did not put up much of a fight here, losing by 9-1 in the semifinals to the Americans. The Canadians became so concerned with the poor competition that after the preliminary round they played a secret practice game against the Vancouver North West Giants, an elite-level boys team. But the final was a display of top-notch women's hockey, played before a loud sellout crowd at Canada Hockey Place that included Prime Minister Stephen Harper. The American goalie, Jessie Vetter, contributed some fine play of her own, denying Cherie Piper as she cut across the slot in the second period and stopping Haley Irwin on a third-period breakaway. She kept the United States in the game, finishing with 26 saves. But the Americans had trouble generating an attack against the Canadian checking. Bigger and stronger, the Canadian women kept riding them off the puck, and when they did get through, Szabados was there, time and again. She did a split while stopping a shot by Monique Lamoureux with a glove save. Later she gloved a shot with Jenny Potter standing right in front, pushing back when Potter fell on top of her. Twice in the third period she denied Lamoureux again, once with a glove save and again by closing her pads on a sharp deflection from 4 feet away. Poulin gave Canada a 1-0 lead at 13 minutes 55 seconds of the opening period when she one-timed a pass from Jennifer Botterill over Vetter's glove. A few minutes later, the teams were playing four skaters a side when the puck came loose off a draw to the left of Vetter, and Poulin was there again. Her quick wrist shot made the score 2-0 at 16:50. The Americans failed to take advantage of two two-player advantages, one in the first, the other in the second. In the third,  they began pressing and pinching but still failed to generate much of an attack and kept getting caught with only one defender back. They were not able to pull Vetter with enough time to make any difference. ''We kept shooting the puck to the glove side,'' the American defender Angela Ruggiero said. ''We should have thrown it low and hoped for rebounds.'' Fighting back tears, she added: ''What hurts the most is how close this team is. It's such a unique team to play on. I felt that this was our year. We had such equal heart, passion and love of the game. We never lost that -- we just couldn't put the puck in the net.'' During the medal ceremony, players from Finland, which won the bronze with a 3-2 overtime victory over Sweden earlier Thursday, smiled and blew kisses as they accepted their medals. The Americans fought back tears as they received their silver medals. The predominantly Canadian crowd joined the American fans in chanting ''U.S.A.! U.S.A.!'' and the players waved back warmly at the salute. The Canadian players beamed happily as they got their gold medals. Poulin, whose goals provided the margin of victory, winked at the camera. ''O Canada'' was played as the flags were raised. The Canadian women linked arms and sang along. To their right, the Americans also linked arms, in a show of respect. ''This rivalry will never end,'' Szabados said. ''It will just keep going on and on.''","In the gold medal game on Thursday, the  and American women's hockey teams finally found worthy opponents: each other.

"WP",2011,"Saudi Arabia","Grabbing the car keys in the House of Saud","This month'sdriving protest by Saudi women, despite significant hype and international coverage, was a far cry from the massive demonstrationsthat have rocked other Arab countries this revolutionary season. Only a few dozen women got behind the wheel, roughly the same number as during the last public driving protest, 20 years ago. The government looks at the numbers and maintains, straight-faced, that women's rights are simply not a big deal to most Saudis. The party line remains the same as King Abdullah patiently expressed to Barbara Walters in a 2005 interview: While he personally believes ""strongly in the rights of women,"" he said, he would not issue a royal decree to allow them to drive. ""I cannot do something that is unacceptable in the eyes of my people."" The problem for the monarch now is that a lot of his people have been looking at YouTube, where the protest is amplified over and over. There, videos posted by protesters show that the world is not upended when women are in the driver's seat. In many of the videos, husbands, fathers and brothers are sitting in the passenger seat, beaming proudly. The women are simply going about their ordinary chores - and changing conservative mores along the way, as the very public debate over the protests makes clear. Saudi restrictions on women are not going to melt away. More likely, a growing middle-class acceptance of women's rights, promoted by activists, business leaders, educators, journalists and even moderate religious leaders, will exacerbate the long-simmering tensions between tradition and modernity, between fundamentalist and moderate Islam, that have gripped Saudi society for decades. Why? Because control over women is at the heart of the harsh version of Islam that Saudi theocracy imposes on the country. The 18th-century bargain struck between Muhammad ibn Saud, a direct forefather of today's ruling Sauds, and Muhammad ibn Abdul Wahhab, the eponymous ""Wahhabi,"" persists: The Sauds have political control of the country, and the descendents of Wahhab exert social and religious control. As revolutions swept the region this spring, Saudi Arabia's ruling clerics offered up helpful fatwas and sermons against public demonstrations and in support of the monarchy. In return, the religious establishment was richly rewarded with about $200 million to their organizations, according to the New York Times. The Saudi government is not about to anger religious conservatives at this tenuous time by going soft on the touchstone issue of women's rights. But the Sauds'  bargain with the clerics that sustains the nation's medieval system will become increasingly unsustainable as more and more Saudis question the restrictions imposed on them in the name of religion. Twenty years ago, when the first group of intrepid women protested by driving around Riyadh, they were roundly denounced in the press and labeled ""whores"" and ""infidels."" Those working in the public sector were fired from their jobs by royal decree. The leading religious authorities quickly issued fatwas formally banning women from driving, saying it contradicts Islam by degrading women's dignity. This time around, Manal al-Sharif, the woman arrested in May for posting videos of herself driving, was quickly lauded as the ""Rosa Parks of Saudi Arabia."" The Facebook group she created, Women2Drive, had more than 20,000 members within a few weeks. It is no surprise that she and Wajeha al-Huwaider, the two most prominent female leaders of the Women2Drive campaign, have both been employed by Saudi Aramco, the national oil company, which plays an important role in Saudi modernization. Saudi critics have mocked the Women2Drive campaign and disparaged its leaders for being divorced and Shiite. A dueling Facebook site called Iqal- after the Arabic word for the cord that holds in place the headdress that men in the Persian Gulf region traditionally wear - urged men to beat women with the cord if they dared to drive. The site was taken off Facebook for inciting violence, but not before thousands ""liked"" it. Some Saudi women have also spoken out against driving and, indeed, against any expansion of women's rights. Rawdah Al-Yousif, for example, is the Phyllis Schlafly of Saudi Arabia. She launched a movement in 2009 called My Guardian Knows What's Best for Me. She argues that Islamic law and Saudi customs mandate the rules that require women to have a guardian's permission to do many essential activities, including accessing government offices such as courts, traveling, studying, seeking employment and getting health care. Her organization is headed by two princesses who, in a Saudi version of let-them-eat-cake, argue that life is easier when men take care of these tasks. Yousif calls her liberal opponents ""ignorant and vexatious,"" and she posted a video on Twitter describing the driving activists as ""Westernized rich brats."" However, several prominent men have urged in opinion pieces that women be allowed to drive, and some outspoken members of the advisory Shura Council have criticized the driving ban in economic terms. They decry the need to import nearly 1 million foreign chauffeurs, who send home more than $4 billion in annual remittances, as a drain on the Saudi economy. Important business leaders have stressed the inefficiencies caused by the ban and acknowledge that it is an embarrassment to them on the international stage. Even some moderate Islamic scholars have stated that there is no religious justification for preventing women from driving. One battle to repress women has already been lost. In the early 1960s, clerics strenuously fought girls' education, arguing that it would start the country down a slippery slope from which there was no return. They were right. Today, some 60 percent of the college graduates in Saudi Arabia are women, and increasingly they clamor for more than the 5 percent of jobs they hold. Several universities now offer engineering degrees for women. The female leaders who fought for those opportunities often said the driving debate was a distraction from their larger concerns. But recent events seem to have changed the minds of some. Saudi journalist and activist Sabria Jawhar says that while she used to think that the endless driving debate was trivial, now ""the driving ban is no longer a distraction to Saudi women's quest for their rights, but could very well be the centerpiece of our struggle to obtain rights long denied us."" She is right. The clerical establishment will not roll over on this issue or on any others pertaining to women's rights. So Saudi women - and men - will have to fight for them and force the royals to choose sides. The kingdom's octogenarian rulers have aligned with the clerics: Abdullah, widely seen as a reformer, made clear long ago that he was interested in only incremental changes for women, and his powerful half-brother, Interior Minister Prince Nayef, who oversees the religious police, takes an even harder line. (He was seen as responsible for arresting and detaining Manal al-Sharif for nine days.)

Only a few dozen women got behind the wheel, roughly the same number as during the last public driving protest, 20 years ago. The government looks at the numbers and maintains, straight-faced, that women's rights are simply not a big deal to most Saudis. The party line remains the same as King  patiently expressed to  in a 2005 interview: While he personally believes ""strongly in the rights of women,"" he said, he would not issue a royal decree to allow them to drive. ""I cannot do something that is unacceptable in the eyes of my people."" The problem for the monarch now is that a lot of his people have been looking at , where the protest is amplified over and over. There, videos posted by protesters show that the world is not upended when women are in the driver's seat. In many of the videos, husbands, fathers and brothers are sitting in the passenger seat, beaming proudly.

"NYT",2003,"Canada","HOCKEY: NOTEBOOK; Olympians Power Harvard","As much as top-ranked Harvard, with three Olympians on the roster, resembles a women's dream team, this season's squad may not be the best team KATE STONE has coached. Stone's 1998-99 Crimson team had four players who had competed or would compete in the Olympics. That team posted a 33-1 record, won the ECAC regular-season and tournament titles, the Beanpot and Ivy League championships and the national championship, which was then under the auspices of the American Women's College Hockey Alliance. This season, Harvard boasts three of the top four scorers in the nation in forwards JENNIFER BOTTERILL (39 goals and 52 assists for 91 points) and JULIE CHU (35-37--72), and ANGELA RUGGIERO, the top-scoring defender in the country (20-47--67). Botterill was on the 1998 and 2002 Canadian Olympic teams. Ruggiero was on the United States Olympic team in 1998 and 2002. Chu played for the United States in 2002. On Feb. 22, Botterill became the leading career scorer in Division I women's hockey, eclipsing the 312 points amassed by GRETCHEN ULION for Dartmouth, ending in 1994. Now with 319 points (149 goals, 170 assists), Botterill will most likely surpass the men's record of 324 points set by Michigan State's TOM ROSS from 1972-76. ""I really appreciate any attention I get, but honestly, that's the last focus of mine when I'm playing hockey,"" Botterill said. ""Since I've been at Harvard, I have had the opportunity to play with so many great players. When you're around great players, you feel very fortunate. Records are an added bonus."" Her coach hesitated when asked if Botterill was the best female hockey player she had seen, pointing out that Ruggiero was ""the best at her position."" Of Botterill, Stone said: ""She's the best skater in the game; powerful, explosive. A clutch player for four years. She plays the game with such great enthusiasm."" A senior from Winnipeg, Manitoba, Botterill says she will continue to play hockey after earning a degree in psychology this spring, but she is not sure she would like to follow her former Canadian Olympic teammate HAYLEY WICKENHEISER, who recently became the first woman to score a goal in a men's professional league while playing in Finland. Harvard (26-1-1, 15-0-1 ECAC) has won the regular-season conference title. Last season, without Botterill and Ruggiero, who were with their national teams, and Chu, who had not yet enrolled, Harvard had an 18-11-2 record. ""It's not always easy,"" Stone said about fielding a team with Olympic-caliber players. ""It's a great privilege to have these kids on your team, but with that comes occasional upheaval when they go away to play on their national teams or go away for a year. So patience is important, and understanding that the benefits totally, totally outweigh the drawbacks.'  Colorado College (24-5-5, 17-4-5) has clinched the regular-season title in the Western Collegiate Hockey Association with one week of play remaining for all except two teams. Minnesota State-Mankato and Alaska-Anchorage have completed their league schedules, and for Alaska-Anchorage the end came none too soon. The Seawolves (0-22-6, 1-24-7) have the worst record in the W.C.H.A. in more than 30 years. Their only victory was against Alaska-Fairbanks of the Central Collegiate Hockey Association. Anchorage and Fairbanks play each other in two games this weekend. Anchorage will face Colorado College, ranked first in the nation, in the first round of the W.C.H.A. tournament, which begins on March 14. The last W.C.H.A. team without a victory in the regular season was Colorado College in 1961-62.

It means a lot to me. My wife was working that day in 7 World Trade Center but fortunately got out O.K., so I was touched deeply by the whole situation."" PAUL BAXTER, a former N.H.L. player and current assistant coach for the Florida Panthers, was in town because Florida played the Rangers. He was able to watch his son, MARCUS, a UConn freshman, play. ""He scored the first goal of the game for his team, so that was pretty exciting."" Marcus Baxter, a 5-foot-9, 155-pound right wing, on scoring a goal on Garden ice: ""Not bad. But one wasn't enough today."" JACK McDONALD, the Quinnipiac athletic director, on the turnout of 2,115 at the afternoon game: ""We're not afraid to start with small steps.

"NYT",2012,"Monaco","Independence From Monaco","WHEN you think of the Grimaldi girls of Monaco, you think of Caroline and Stephanie, the young princesses whose preternatural beauty, jet-setting ways and tabloid-ready romances long made them paparazzi favorites. So it comes as a shock to learn they are now middle-aged women, with Caroline actually older than their mother, Princess Grace, was when she died in a car accident at age 52. Now the spotlight is falling on a third generation of Grimaldis, most notably on Charlotte Casiraghi, the 25-year-old daughter of Caroline and her second husband, Stephano Casiraghi, a young Italian businessman who died in a speedboat accident when Charlotte was 4. To flee the relentless eye of the public and the press, Caroline whisked Charlotte and her two siblings off to a sheltered life, first to a country house in southern France, then to Fontainebleau, near Paris, when Caroline remarried. Over the years, Charlotte showed up on the paparazzi radar screen episodically. Like the time a survey declared her one of the most eligible young women in the world -- when she was only 16. Now she is coming out in a different and very public way: by posing for the fashion cameras. Last fall, Vogue France featured her on its cover, with a 24-page fashion shoot inside. She wore Cartier diamond earrings, suede Louboutin pumps and clothes by Dior, Chanel and Celine, among others. Earlier this year, she made her debut as the new face of Gucci, in an ambitious advertising campaign that celebrates her passion for competitive show jumping. Charlotte ''not only embodies the beauty and the grace of the equestrian, but is also a wonderful ambassador for the sport,'' Frida Giannini, Gucci's creative director, said when the campaign began. Ms. Casiraghi's work seems linked to a desire to create her own identity and assert her independence from Monaco, a Mediterranean tax haven a little more than half the size of Central Park. ''She has an opportunity to step out into real life and say, 'Oh, I'm here!' '' said Peter Lindbergh, who photographed Ms. Casiraghi for the Gucci campaign and has known her and her family for years. ''It was a big decision for her, to get out of the house and get involved with advertising.'' Just don't call her a model. ''Protagonist'' is the word Gucci uses to define Ms. Casiraghi's role in its campaign, entitled ''Forever Now.'' Ms. Casiraghi insists she is promoting only the Gucci ''spirit,'' not Gucci products. ''I've always refused to associate myself with a brand,'' she told French Elle. The ad campaign ''pays homage to the Gucci spirit, to 90 years of the history of the house, to our common passion for horsemanship. I do not represent any product or any collection.'' Her life could have turned out differently. She could have stayed in Monaco as an accessory to the court of her uncle Prince Albert II. Even though she is not a princess, she is fourth in line to the princely throne. (Her father was a commoner, and titles in Monaco are not transmitted through the mother.) ''I'm not a princess,'' she told French Vogue. ''My mother is, not I. I am the niece of a head of state. And with this status, I have some representational duties, nothing very constraining or very exceptional.'' As a student, she was considered gifted but failed to make it into the Ecole Normale Superieure, one of France's elite grandes ecoles. She studied philosophy at the Sorbonne instead. She evolved into a competitive equestrian and a lover of expensive clothes and has dabbled in writing, editing and videography. She lives much of the time in Paris. She rarely talks to the press, and when she does, access is brief. (She declined through her representatives to be interviewed for this article.) She appears only occasionally at official events in Monaco, and when she does, she glows. With her full lips, sultry eyes and loose, long chestnut hair that whips across her face in the wind, she is so strikingly beautiful that even staid diplomats gush. ''She is a stunning, luminous person,'' said Hugues Moret, the French ambassador to Monaco. ''She glows from the inside and radiates beauty and soft warmth.'' Wearing a cornflower-blue strapless Chanel gown with diamond and platinum jewelry at this year's gala fund-raiser, Bal de la Rose, she stole the spotlight from Princess Charlene, Albert's South African-born bride. And she played second fiddle only to the bride at their wedding last year, wearing a pink off-the-shoulder Chanel confection. Despite her status as a commoner, her pedigree can be a burden. Her relationship with Alex Dellal, a London gallery owner, which apparently ended in late 2011, was documented in celebrity magazines and on the Internet. Her 24-year-old brother, Pierre Casiraghi, was in the news in February because of an altercation at the Double Seven, a club in the meatpacking district in New York. He was briefly hospitalized. In January, the weekly Paris Match and three French celebrity magazines ran cover articles linking her romantically with Gad Elmaleh, one of France's best-known comedic actors, who is 16 years her senior. ''The Amorous Weekend of the Princess and the Humorist'' ran the cover headline of Paris Match. One photo showed Ms. Casiraghi, in sneakers and without makeup, ostensibly leaving his Paris apartment on Sunday afternoon, the day after she arrived. Ms. Casiraghi sued the magazines, not only in civil court but -- in an unusual step -- in criminal court as well. It is common practice for publications in Europe to pay stiff fines for what is considered an invasion of ''private life,'' but in this case, the judge went much further. Paris Match was required to run a large black-and-white banner across the bottom of a cover informing readers that it had been ''condemned'' in civil court for violating her rights. The criminal case is pending. The Gucci ad campaign builds on a long and comfortable relationship the fashion house has with her family. Princess Grace (who, as Grace Kelly, modeled briefly in New York before becoming an Oscar-winning actress and a princess) was one of its most important clients. Gucci even made a scarf for her, called the Flora. Princess Caroline also wears Gucci from time to time. As for Ms. Casiraghi, Ms. Giannini, the Gucci creative director, has designed an equestrian wardrobe for her for the last three years. The company has also sponsored her equestrian activities, although the amount of support has not been made public. According to Stephane Bern, the French celebrity journalist who has covered the principality and its first family for years, Ms. Casiraghi offered to participate in the campaign because she needed money to support her horses. ''She has absolutely no interest in being a model, she's much too intelligent for that,'' Mr. Bern said. ''But competing in horse competitions costs a lot of money. You have to transport your horses one day to Dubai, the next day to Spain, pay for their care, the trainer. Gucci helps by writing checks with lots of zeros.'' Ms. Casiraghi's new partnership with the brand expands their relationship. She has already posed for Mr. Lindbergh, whose images focus on the red- and green-striped Gucci webbing. She resisted dressing in all-Gucci, and she pushed to wear her own crimson-red vintage Gucci jacket. She will pose for three other famous photographers in celebrating other symbols of Gucci's horse-loving spirit. (Next comes the Gucci bit for horses.) ''She's a marvelous, marvelous kid,'' Mr. Lindbergh said. ''In the pictures I took, she looks exactly the way I see her in normal life. People say she's not a princess. But the way I see it, Gucci has a princess now.'' There's a potential risk, however. ''Honestly, it's rare to see someone so smart in this milieu,'' Mr. Bern said. ''But there's a contradiction. She's so intelligent, and this is such a frivolous world.''","WHEN you think of the  girls of , you think of  and , the young princesses whose preternatural beauty, jet-setting ways and tabloid-ready romances long made them paparazzi favorites.

She appears only occasionally at official events in , and when she does, she glows. With her full lips, sultry eyes and loose, long chestnut hair that whips across her face in the wind, she is so strikingly beautiful that even staid diplomats gush. ''She is a stunning, luminous person,'' said , the French ambassador to . ''She glows from the inside and radiates beauty and soft warmth.'' Wearing a cornflower-blue strapless  gown with diamond and platinum jewelry at this year's gala fund-raiser, , she stole the spotlight from Princess , 's South African-born bride. And she played second fiddle only to the bride at their wedding last year, wearing a pink off-the-shoulder  confection. Despite her status as a commoner, her pedigree can be a burden. Her relationship with , a  gallery owner, which apparently ended in late 2011, was documented in celebrity magazines and on the Internet. Her 24-year-old brother, , was in the news in February because of an altercation at the Double Seven, a club in the meatpacking district in . He was briefly hospitalized. In January, the weekly  and three French celebrity magazines ran cover articles linking her romantically with , one of 's best-known comedic actors, who is 16 years her senior. ''The Amorous Weekend of the Princess and the Humorist'' ran the cover headline of . One photo showed Ms. , in sneakers and without makeup, ostensibly leaving his  apartment on Sunday afternoon, the day after she arrived. Ms.  sued the magazines, not only in civil court but -- in an unusual step -- in criminal court as well. It is common practice for publications in  to pay stiff fines for what is considered an invasion of ''private life,'' but in this case, the judge went much further.  was required to run a large black-and-white banner across the bottom of a cover informing readers that it had been ''condemned'' in civil court for violating her rights. The criminal case is pending. The  ad campaign builds on a long and comfortable relationship the fashion house has with her family. Princess  (who, as  Kelly, modeled briefly in  before becoming an Oscar-winning actress and a princess) was one of its most important clients.  even made a scarf for her, called the Flora. Princess  also wears  from time to time. As for Ms. , Ms. , the  creative director, has designed an equestrian wardrobe for her for the last three years. The company has also sponsored her equestrian activities, although the amount of support has not been made public. According to , the French celebrity journalist who has covered the principality and its first family for years, Ms.  offered to participate in the campaign because she needed money to support her horses. ''She has absolutely no interest in being a model, she's much too intelligent for that,'' Mr.  said. ''But competing in horse competitions costs a lot of money. You have to transport your horses one day to , the next day to , pay for their care, the trainer.  helps by writing checks with lots of zeros.'' Ms. 's new partnership with the brand expands their relationship. She has already posed for Mr. , whose images focus on the red- and green-striped  webbing. She resisted dressing in all-, and she pushed to wear her own crimson-red vintage  jacket. She will pose for three other famous photographers in celebrating other symbols of 's horse-loving spirit. (Next comes the  bit for horses.) ''She's a marvelous, marvelous kid,'' Mr.  said. ''In the pictures I took, she looks exactly the way I see her in normal life. People say she's not a princess. But the way I see it,  has a princess now.'' There's a potential risk, however. ''Honestly, it's rare to see someone so smart in this milieu,'' Mr.  said. ''But there's a contradiction. She's so intelligent, and this is such a frivolous world.''"
"NYT",2011,"France","Indignation, Anger and Confusion in France Over Strauss-Kahn Case","Days after the revelation that the case against Dominique Strauss-Kahn was on the verge of collapse, France reacted with a mix of Gallic indignation at the American justice system, fevered speculation about his political rehabilitation and visceral anger by some  feminists that the former head of the International Monetary Fund was now being cast as a victim. The almost overnight transformation of D.S.K. -- as Dominique Strauss-Kahn is widely known in France -- from alleged sexual predator to seeming victim of an unscrupulous accuser has riveted and divided the country. The news that the Sofitel maid who had accused D.S.K. of rape had repeatedly lied to prosecutors has also spurred talk of a political comeback for the one-time French presidential contender that only weeks ago was deemed impossible. Citing a Harris Interactive poll in the French daily Le Parisien, Le Monde noted Sunday that  49 percent of the French people surveyed favored D.S.K.'s return to politics while 45 percent opposed it. Le Monde reported that despite the renewed support for D.S.K., only 43 percent wanted the Socialists to delay primaries to allow Mr. Strauss-Kahn -- who cannot travel outside the United States because of the charges against him -- to re-enter the race. The poll has a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percent. ""Let's all stay calm,"" Gérard Le Gall, a public opinion expert and a Socialist, said hours before a court in Manhattan changed the terms of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's bail, freeing him on his own recognizance. ""The version of the story has changed before and could change again. It's too early to draw any conclusions."" Jean-Francois Cope, the secretary-general of the ruling center-right UMP party of French President Nicolas Sarkozy said Sunday that the return of D.S.K. to French politics was a matter for the Left, the newspaper Liberation reported. But Mr. Sarkozy's sports minister, Chantal Jouanno, was less diplomatic, insisting that Mr. Strauss-Kahn had undermined France's image globally. ""He has not given a very positive image of France in recent days, between his appetites for luxury and other things,"" she said dryly. Leading the charge of those seeking to rehabilitate D.S.K. is Bernard-Henri Levy, the French intellectual and darling of the Left in France, who was eviscerated by feminists in the aftermath of the arrest for defending a man accused of being a sexual predator. Mr. Levy has now cast D.S.K. in the role of a modern-day Dreyfus, insisting that he had been unfairly maligned by a frothing-at-the-mouth American media that he characterized as obscene to the point of being ""pornographic."" Writing in The Daily Beast, Mr. Levy said that there were five lessons to be drawn from the incident, which he said would soon be known as the ""Strauss-Kahn non-affair.""  Calling for the restoration of Mr. Strauss-Kahn's honor, along with his freedom, Mr. Levy said that justice in the case had been cannibalized by a grotesque sideshow during which the former banking chief had been globally humiliated, subjected to a perverse ""perp walk"" and denigrated by the media for a crime that had yet to be proved. ""The 'shame on you's' that greeted Dominique Strauss-Kahn as he arrived for the hearing on June 6th, shouted by battalions of hotel chambermaids who knew nothing of the actual case and whose protest had been orchestrated and scripted, were obscene,"" he wrote.  ""This vision of Dominique Strauss-Kahn humiliated in chains, dragged lower than the gutter - this degradation of a man whose silent dignity couldn't be touched, was not just cruel, it was pornographic."" Warming to his theme, Mr. Levy contended that D.S.K. had been dehumanized and transformed into a global hate figure in the same manner that Maximilien Robespierre had demonized those whom he deemed enemies during the French Revolution.* ""America the pragmatic, that rebels against ideologies, this country of habeas corpus that de Tocqueville claimed possessed the most democratic system of justice in the world, has pushed this French Robespierrism, unfortunately, to the extremes of its craziness,"" he said. ""In this case, Dominique Strauss-Kahn was no longer Dominique Strauss-Kahn. He was the symbol of arrogant France. He was the emblem of the world of the privileged, odiously sure of their own impunity."" He noted that the D.S.K. affair had laid bare the grievous temptation the world over to sanctify the words of victims. He insisted that one of the biggest victims in the case was the very principle, in the United States, of the presumption of innocence. ""He was crushed, then, by that fraction of the American judicial apparatus that, by putting Dominique Strauss-Kahn in stocks, by humiliating him before the entire world, by ruthlessly pursuing him, has probably ruined his life,"" Mr. Levy wrote. Invoking George W. Bush's notion of pre-emptive war, he said that Cyrus Vance Jr., the Manhattan district attorney who had pursued the case against D.S.K., had pioneered a new concept, scarcely less horrifying, of ""pre-emptive penalty."" Indeed, Mr. Vance's conduct was subjected to scrutiny in the French media over the weekend, which reported that the Manhattan district attorney now faced the same media backlash that only days before had been directed against Mr. Strauss-Kahn. An article in Le Figaro that now that the case had turned in Mr. Strauss-Kahn's favor, Mr. Vance faced the ire of a voracious media.   ""The D.S.K. affair should have been the case of his life. Instead, it could prove a fatal blow to his career,"" the paper said. While some French critics attacked the American media and judicial system over the affair, others continued to expound the theory that Accor, the French hotel group that owns the Sofitel Hotel, was somehow . Francois Loncle, a Socialist member of Parliament, criticized the Accor Group, implying that its owners, had played a role in the arrest. ""Not all is clear about the role of Sofitel's management and the group Accor,"" Mr. Loncle said, adding that there may be unspecified ""links"" between Accor and certain underground French political forces. The French media have reported a close connection between Accor's owners and Mr. Sarkozy's center right UMP Party. Also underlying the debate in France has been whether the new revelations about Mr. Strauss-Kahn's accuser have undermined the cause of feminism in France. Many Frenchwomen have been outraged by the speed with which Mr. Strauss-Kahn has been once again embraced as a possible candidate for President, while the felony charges against him remain. At a meeting of French feminists over the weekend near Paris, many of those gathered said that the contention that the maid was a liar changed nothing.  ""If journalists think that this moment of political theater changes our way of seeing things, they are wrong,"" Caroline de Haas, one of the assembled, told Le Monde.

"WP",2001,"Iran","Iran's Women Say Yes to Khatami; Many Will Vote for Him Today but Wonder if He Can Reform System","In a magazine interview during his first days as president of Iran, Mohammad Khatami was asked who had the final word in his household -- he or his wife. ""I do,"" Khatami replied. ""And it's 'Yes, Madam!' "" It was just the kind of against-the-grain comment in this strict Islamic society that has endeared Khatami to Iranian women who, along with the country's youth vote, propelled him to an overwhelming victory four years ago. When Iranians go to the polls Friday, women -- the segment of society that arguably has benefited most from Khatami's presidency -- are again expected to be a powerful source of support in his anticipated reelection over nine mostly conservative rivals. Under Khatami's leadership, women have made unprecedented gains in a country where conservative clerics have used their rigid interpretation of Islam for the past 22 years to impose stringent dress codes, rules of behavior, career limitations and domestic control over women. Khatami has put record numbers of women in senior advisory positions in his government, expanded opportunities that allowed women this year to claim 60 percent of the seats in universities and facilitated liberties in dress and social conduct that would have gotten women and girls arrested four years ago. ""Mr. Khatami has changed the psychological atmosphere of the society concerning women and men,"" said Elahe Koolaee, one of the 11 female members of Iran's parliament and a Khatami supporter. ""These changes are very important."" ""The first words he used in his campaign were support for women's rights and freedom,"" said Firoozeh Parchni, 25, a university student who said she will vote to reelect him. ""Iranian society is a man's society, and we want to share it. We want to be able to show what we want. We're sick of censorship."" But like much of his ambitious reform program, many of Khatami's efforts to make significant changes in the laws and institutions that govern women's lives have been thwarted by hard-line conservatives who consider maintaining the traditional views of a woman's place in Islamic society a critical firewall against encroachment by undesireable Western influences. Although Iran's elected parliament, called the Majlis, is controlled by reformists and has passed groundbreaking legislation granting greater rights to women in divorce cases, education and other areas, most bills have been vetoed by the Guardian Council, an appointive body of 12 conservative Islamic scholars and clerics that reviews all laws for adherence to Islamic principles. And while the reform movement has tried to open the workplace to more women, Khatami's term has been marked by an economic downturn that has pushed unemployment to 25 percent. Economists estimate that as few as 10 percent of women graduating from college can find jobs. As a result, while women can now nudge their scarves farther back on their heads, hold hands with their boyfriends on the streets of upscale neighborhoods and wear makeup in public without harassment from the morals police, they are becoming increasingly disheartened by the failures of the reform movement. ""I know he's the right person, but I'm really frustrated -- 100 percent,"" said Masourmeh Farrokhi, 20, a psychology student at Tehran University. ""He hasn't been given the opportunity to make changes, and people wanted really big, fundamental changes. You can't say a certain body is to blame. There are numerous actors -- [it's] the entire atmosphere of the country."" Other women are even harsher in their assessments and are joining the growing chorus of voices questioning the religious system of government installed after the 1979 Islamic revolution that overthrew Iran's Western-backed monarch, Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi. ""We brought Khatami in to change the system and nothing happened,"" said Rosa Omidvar, 25, a kindergarten director who said she will not vote. ""The only thing I want is real freedom, the kind where you feel in your heart that you are a free member of society."" Khatami conceded in a news conference this week that ""we have not been able yet to respect the rights and talents of women to the extent they deserve."" Iranian women are permitted greater freedoms than women in some neighboring Islamic countries, yet the country's religious laws and codes are criticized harshly by women's rights proponents both inside and outside the country. A woman's testimony carries only half the credibility of a man's in court; laws governing divorce, child custody and family matters place nearly all authority in the hands of husbands and fathers; and the ""blood money"" paid by a murderer to a victim's family in lieu of receiving the death penalty is half the amount for a woman as a man. Punishments for morals violations remain harsh, as evidenced last month when a 35-year-old woman was buried up to her armpits and stoned to death on charges of producing and acting in pornographic films eight years ago. ""What's the problem?"" said Grand Ayatollah Yousef Saanei, a high-ranking liberal cleric who has advocated equal rights for women. ""I answer with one word: tradition."" He added: ""Those who aim at enslaving women . . . are fighting awareness among the people because they are frightened. . . . Later, the people will raise criticisms against their deeds and their performance, and they will start hating these rulers."" The strong support women have given Khatami has spurred some conservative politicians and clerics to begin rethinking the role of women in Islamic society. ""The time is past when men preached that women are the leftovers of the universe,"" said Mohammad Javad Larijani, a leading theoretician of Iran's right wing. ""Now we are facing educated women demanding jobs and recognition."" Some of the toughest battles over women's rights have been fought between parliament and the Guardian Council. The council has used its veto power on bills ranging from raising the marriage age of girls from 9 to 14 without court approval to giving women more rights in divorce cases. Zahra Eshraqi, 38, has been in the forefront of that issue and others as a director of policymaking in the Interior Ministry's Office for Women's Affairs. She came to the job with a unique background: Eshraqi is the granddaughter of the late Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini -- the Islamic republic's most revered leader -- and the wife of the president's brother, Mohammad Reza Khatami, a leading member of parliament. She said the council has obstructed bills expanding women's rights ""because of the traditional way they've been thinking. Someone should tell them their thought is wrong. People in society are against it and it should be thrown away."" Fatemeh Haqiqatjoo, a legislator who was arrested for a speech she made on the floor of the parliament criticizing the brutal treatment of a female journalist by police, said she is encouraged by the increased participation of women both at high levels of Khatami's administration and in rural villages and small cities. Reformers have helped push implementation of long-ignored laws against discrimination that have resulted, for instance, in 781 women being elected to village and city councils across Iran during Khatami's first term. ""There used to be such a masculine look in those cities,"" Haqiqatjoo said, her voice raspy from spending several days campaigning for Khatami. ""Now women are participating more and people are looking up to them."" But it's not only conservative government councils and village men who question some of the social changes Khatami and other reformers advocate. ""Khatami has given a lot of freedoms, but he has been going too far,"" said Tahereh Horri, a 41-year-old mother of three who lives in Islamshahr, about an hour's drive south of Tehran. ""Girls and boys don't observe the moralities. This is no good. Go to the park and have a look!""

"NYT",2003,"Iran","Iranian Lawyer, Staunch Fighter For Human Rights, Wins Nobel","Shirin Ebadi, an Iranian lawyer little known outside her country, became the first Muslim woman to win the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday, recognition for her work promoting the rights of women and children in Iran. In awarding the prize to Ms. Ebadi, a ""courageous person,"" the Nobel committee said it wished to prod the Muslim world into recognizing that Islam and human rights could go hand in hand. It also hoped to embolden the struggling reform movement in Iran at a time of widespread turbulence and upheaval in the Middle East. Iran, a nation of 66 million Muslims, is in the midst of a power struggle between Islamic conservatives and modernists, led by the embattled president, Mohammad Khatami, and is under intense international scrutiny over the question of nuclear weapons. Ms. Ebadi, 56, a lawyer, writer and university lecturer, has spent three decades advancing human rights in Iran and fostering a dialogue between hard-liners and reformists. At a news conference in Paris, where she was visiting, Ms. Ebadi immediately tested her newfound acclaim by calling for the release of political prisoners in Iran and cautioning the United States not to intervene in Iran's domestic affairs. ""Today many people who fight for liberty and democracy are in prison, and I hope for their release as soon as possible,"" Ms. Ebadi said. ""I call on the Iranian government to respect human rights and I hope in the future things will move positively."" In Iran, news that Shirin Ebadi (SHEE-REEN eh-baw-DEE) had won one of the world's most celebrated prizes, an award that typically carries political overtones, was received with mixed reactions. The state-run radio took several hours to make the announcement, and the first reports were brief and muted in tone. The evening television news buried its cursory mention of the award. ""In the name of the Islamic Republic of Iran's government, I congratulate Dr. Ebadi,"" Abdollah Ramazanzadeh, the spokesman for Iran's reformist government, said in the first official reaction, according to Reuters. A representative of President Khatami will show support by attending a welcoming ceremony on her return to the country, he said. In a pointed critique of the United States, which accuses Iran of secretly working to develop nuclear weapons, Ms. Ebadi said outsiders had no right to meddle.

"NYT",2011,"Iraq","Iraqi Women Feel Shunted Despite Election Quota","BAGHDAD -- Iraqi women hoped that last year's election would cement a larger role for them in the government. But they have less political influence today than at any time since the American invasion. No women took part in the protracted negotiations to reach a compromise government. And despite holding a quarter of the seats in Parliament, only one woman runs a ministry: women's affairs, a largely ceremonial department with a tiny budget and few employees. In the previous government from 2006 to 2010, four women led ministries, and in the government from 2005 to 2006, six did, including the influential ones governing public works, refugees and communications. ''I consider it a disaster,'' said Ashwaq Abbas, a female member of Parliament from the Kurdish Alliance bloc. ''Democracy should also include women, and the rights of women should be developed as the democracy here develops. But what's actually happened is that the rights of women have gotten worse over time.'' Shortly after Prime Minister Nuri Kamal al-Maliki managed to retain his post in December, he pledged to appoint women as ministers. On the day he announced several members of his cabinet, one lawmaker declined to accept an appointment to be the minister of women's affairs because she was outraged that so few women held such positions. In her place, Mr. Maliki appointed a man on an interim basis and eventually appointed a woman. Women have long struggled for rights in the Arab world, but Iraq's Constitution requires that a quarter of the members of Parliament be women. (Roughly 17 percent of the members of the United States Congress are women.) Whether the quota has actually advanced the causes of women or served as window dressing remains unclear six years after Iraq ratified its Constitution. But the inability of Iraqi women to increase their influence in Parliament has underscored wider fears that women could lose standing in other facets of life, too, amid an overall drift toward more religious conservatism. The biggest barriers for women in Parliament here are the leaders of the four blocs that eventually backed Mr. Maliki as prime minister. Each is made up of several political parties that have leaders who negotiated ministry positions as part of their agreements to join the governing coalition. ''We ended up with a power-sharing government that has all these party leaders rushing in to get their share of the pie, and the leaders are nearly all men,'' said Reidar Visser, a senior research fellow at the Norwegian Institute of International Affairs and the author of ''A Responsible End? The United States and the Iraqi Transition, 2005-2010.'' ''As part of the agreements to form the government, party leaders tend to want ministries in exchange for joining the coalition, and there are so many parties in the coalition and only so many posts,'' he said. Women have also struggled in Parliament because few have their own power bases. Only 5 of the 86 female lawmakers actually got enough votes to win seats without the quota. The remaining 81 were put there by party leaders because of the Constitution's mandate. ''Many of those women who were chosen as part of the political parties were chosen because they were relatives of members of the party,'' said Safia Taleb al-Souhail, a member of Parliament who is part of the State of Law bloc, which Mr. Maliki leads. ''The parties didn't really think to have women inside the party itself, and just chose many of the women, like, two weeks before the election,'' Ms. Souhail said. ''This is what I meant exactly: there are not a lot of serious politicians.'' She said that men from her own bloc often excluded her and other women from closed meetings to discuss strategy. Iraq was once at the forefront of women's rights. In the 1950s, it became the first Arab country to have a female minister and to have a law that gave women the ability to ask for divorces. But under Saddam Hussein, women had no role in the government, and the resistance movements were dominated by men. After he was ousted in 2003, women successfully lobbied the American administrator in Iraq, L. Paul Bremer III, to set up the constitutional requirement that a quarter of Parliament's members be women. There are demographic pressures in play, too. Today, women are believed to make up a disproportionate percentage of the Iraqi population, at least in part because so many men have died in wars in the past three decades. Iraq has not conducted a census since 1997, but the country's electoral commission estimates that women cast 55 percent to 62 percent of the votes in the election last March. ''There are widows and women from divorce who are unable to support themselves, and there is a need for new laws to protect them, and they have not been addressed,'' said Nahida al-Daeni, a woman in the Iraqiya bloc. ''It will be difficult for men to deal with this because women know best what women suffer from.'' Several women, including Ms. Souhail, would like to extend the 25 percent quota to the ministries' leadership, but analysts agree the chances of that are almost nil. Female politicians are divided, as well, with some who are more Westernized and others who are more rooted in Islamic traditions. In fact, several women in Parliament said that they were content just being part of the government, and that the women wanting ministerial positions were just complaining to gain attention. ''The Iraqi women need to be more qualified so they can't just impose themselves on a position,'' said Emman Galal, a member of Parliament who wears the black abaya and represents the Sadrist faction, a Shiite political group loyal to the anti-American cleric Moktada al-Sadr. Adelah Homod, a lawmaker from the State of Law bloc who wears a head covering, said that women in Parliament should not complain about their lack of power because few of them had the necessary experience to be part of the government. Ms. Souhail rejected that notion, saying she and many other women had played significant roles in lobbying the American government during its occupation of Iraq. ''We have to start somewhere as a society, and it's unfortunate that we are starting here,'' Ms. Souhail said. ''We have much more to go.'' 7 Iraqi Soldiers Fatally Shot Seven Iraqi soldiers were fatally shot in an ambush on Saturday morning as they left their base near Mosul to head home on vacation. It was the deadliest single attack on security forces in weeks. The soldiers, unarmed and wearing civilian clothes, were riding in a Kia minibus when two sedans pulled up and blocked their path. Four gunmen carrying automatic rifles jumped out of the cars, opened fire and then sped off down a dirt road. The driver of the minibus was seriously wounded. Security officials blamed Al Qaeda in Mesopotamia, which has carried out a campaign of assassinations and bombings against police officers, soldiers and politicians and government employees. Atheel al-Nujaifi, the governor of Nineveh Province, criticized Iraq's government as failing to take adequate steps to address the violence that continues to plague the area. ''It will continue unless the government take serious and quick measurements,'' Mr. Nujaifi said."," --  women hoped that last year's election would cement a larger role for them in the government.

"NYT",2004,"Iraq","Iraqi Women's Window of Opportunity for Political Gains Is Closing","Emboldened by the fall of Saddam Hussein, Iraqi women are pushing for political freedoms many of them have never enjoyed. But as they do, a rising tide of religious zeal threatens even the small victories they have won. Ibtisam Ali and her sister, Raghad, have spearheaded a petition drive demanding a large percentage of seats for women in a new national assembly. But when Raghad, 25, tried to run for local office, the men at the candidate registration office informed her that women could not be candidates. ''I was frightened of the people in my neighborhood,'' Raghad said. ''They looked at me so strangely, like I thought I was equal to men. I'm afraid of everything, from gossip to violence. It just kills the ambitions inside.'' Women, secular and religious, from all ethnic groups, now run for office and demand a fair share of representation in a country where they make up 60 percent of the population. Yet new religious activism in Iraq has aggravated traditional attitudes about women's roles in society. The 18-member committee drafting the new constitution does not include any women, according to members of the Iraqi Governing Council. The council recently passed a nonbinding resolution calling for Shariah, or Islamic law, to govern family issues, which Iraq's justice minister said would damage the rights of Iraqi women. And on the streets, more women, even little girls, are covering their heads and bodies, largely because of a fear of harassment and violence, said a range of secular and religious women. ''Women are waking up and getting it now,'' said Manal Omar, the Iraq country director of Women for Women International, a Washington-based group that helps women in countries newly emerged from war. ''They realize that if they don't move now, they will pay the price for years and years to come.'' For 35 years, Iraqi women were able to get university degrees, study overseas and hold high-level professional posts. They were actually discouraged from wearing the hijab, the traditional Muslim head scarf. But in the 1990's, as Mr. Hussein embraced Islam as a source of credibility in the Arab world, his government clamped down on women. Although they continued to attend schools and hold jobs, they were no longer allowed to travel on their own. In general, said Zainab Salbi, an Iraqi-American who is president of Women for Women International, in Washington, women abandoned public life, leaving politics to men. More women started to cover themselves, although wearing hijab became the norm only after Mr. Hussein's ouster. Many Iraqi women believed that with the arrival of the Americans, they would gain more rights. In Hilla, about 60 miles south of Baghdad, women are pressing for those rights, with the help of some men, and battling the anger roused by their efforts. One recent afternoon, Ibtisam Ali stood before the staff of the Human Rights Association of Babylon asking for signatures on a petition demanding that 40 percent of seats in the new national assembly be set aside for women. The signature drive has spread across the country. Ms. Ali, a tall, eloquent woman, was reluctant to push too hard after a man recently told her that women did not deserve equal representation because they were not equal to men. ''If, after all this, the governing council gives us 10 or 20 percent, that will be a blessing,'' she told the group. Hafidh Mejbas, an older man who works for the human rights association, coached her, saying: ''Don't mention 10 or 20 percent all the time. Insist on the 40 percent.'' Ms. Ali cheered up and gave petitions to men and women so they might gather signatures. She has been to villages and gotten signatures from women washing clothes on the river banks. She has persuaded their sheiks, or tribal leaders, to sign, too, she said. But at the same human rights center is a friend of Ms. Ali's who was badly beaten by some men over the summer after she went to the market with her head uncovered. The woman is still too ashamed to talk. Thanaa Salman, a 27-year-old school principal, pushed her way into local politics. She was elected to her neighborhood council, but the elections for its presidency were held without her knowledge, she said. So she contacted the Americans who had organized the vote and demanded a new election. It was held, and she won the presidency by a narrow margin. Still, men tell her every day that she is destined to fail. ''Iraqi women now have more freedom, more opportunity, so, more problems,'' Ms. Salman said. The broader political concerns of the women in Hilla reflect those of most politically active women in Iraq. There is the issue of representation, especially on the all-male constitutional committee. Women like Ibtisam Ali say they do not trust male politicians to adequately protect freedom of religion and expression in a new constitution. Those suspicions have arisen lately because of efforts by religious parties in the Governing Council to push through Resolution 137, which would abolish a 1959 law that the justice minister, Hashim Abdul-Rahman al-Shibli, says drew on the most generous protections for women and children from different schools of Shariah. ''Women don't want clerics to write the constitution,'' Ms. Salman said. According to Mr. Shibli, the resolution would stipulate that a Shiite woman, for example, would have her divorce adjudicated by Shiite law, a Sunni by Sunni law. Besides atomizing the law into many laws, Mr. Shibli noted, such a move would strip every woman of some rights. Inheritance rights for women are more generous under Shiite law than Sunni, but divorce protections are better under Sunni law. So a Shiite woman would still have some good inheritance protections but would see her divorce rights diminished. ''It will have a negative impact on women's lives,'' Mr. Shibli said. The resolution has been frozen for now by the Americans who run Iraq, and a move is on by some Governing Council members to void it entirely. But supporters of it, like the Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq, indicate that they would like to bring it up again once Iraq gains its sovereignty, because they feel its respects the diversity of Iraq. ''Anyone can respect their own law: Shia, Sunni, Christians,'' said Adel Abdel Mahdi, the top aide to Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, a Governing Council member from Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in Iraq. ''This doesn't take privileges from people, but gives them instead.'' The new possibilities and dangers collide in the life of Fatennal Ramahi. Fluent in English and German, Ms. Ramahi stopped working for the last 13 years because she was unwilling to inform on foreign employers. Now, she works for Women for Women. Depressed about staying at home, Ms. Ramahi, a 45-year-old mother of four, began wearing the hijab, a few years ago. When she began work, she took off the scarf. ''I feel back to my own self,'' she said in her office, her lush auburn hair brushing the neck of her black sweater. Pointing at her smiling face, she said, ''This is the real me.'' Though she is a religious Muslim who prays and fasts, her decision to take off her scarf amounts to a grave transgression in the eyes of some, and they let her know it. ''The other day, I was crossing the street when a boy who was the same age as my son began shouting at me, very, very bad words,'' Ms. Ramahi said, her smile vanishing as she looked down at her desk, unwilling to repeat those words. ''I hear those words in my head still. I keep asking myself, 'Why didn't you talk to him?' Then I thought, 'I don't dare.'

"WP",2011,"Egypt","Is revolution bad for women's rights?","On Friday, Egyptians again gathered in Cairo's Tahrir Square, this time in a victory celebration, one week after their revolution http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/02/11/AR2011021102386. html-URL-unseated President Hosni Mubarak. Tunisians have also been sampling new freedoms of speech and press along a boulevard that is no longer a war zone. But even as the exultation lingers, women in both countries have launched new protests. They want to make sure that democracy does not erode their rights. In Tunisia, several hundred women have already taken to the streets to voice their concern about what an Islamic revival, should it come, could mean for them. In Egypt, women's rights activists immediately mounted a petition drive when the committee named to draft a new constitution included not a single woman (although many noted female Egyptian lawyers could easily serve on that committee). In both countries, there is popular support for a broader establishment of sharia, or Islamic law, developed from the Koran and religious writings. Of course, there is no single sharia; interpretations vary throughout the Middle East and are subject to change. Morocco, for example, sets the legal age of female marriage at 18, based on its more progressive version of sharia, whereas in Saudi Arabia girls as young as 8 are married to much older men, based on its version. As new leaders in the region grapple with how to blend some version of sharia with some version of democracy, women's rights will become a central element of the debate. The laws affecting women in Tunisia, and to some extent in Egypt, are among the most progressive in the Middle East, so the potential for backsliding in those countries is real. And women in Yemen, Bahrain, Libya and Iraq, where the spreading unrest has been met with government force, have also struggled for their rights  and likewise have reason to be concerned if their governments fall or start handing out concessions. Tunisia, in particular, has been a bastion of women's rights in a region known for the opposite. Shortly after independence in 1956, President Habib Bourguiba, the country's secular authoritarian leader, pushed through a Personal Status Code which was remarkably liberal for its time. It granted women equal divorce rights to men, abolished polygamy, set minimum marriage ages, allowed access to birth control and even some access to abortion. Bourguiba modeled himself on Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, Turkey's founder who force-marched his country into the modern age through a painful process of secularization - ""for the people, despite the people,"" as he once quipped. The result is that Tunisian women today enjoy relatively high literacy and have achieved broad gains in law, medicine, business, academia and media. Islam, meanwhile, has been tightly regulated; in Zine el-Abidine Ben Ali's police state, it was not uncommon for the authorities to question a person for switching mosques or attending one more than once a week. Popular Islamist leaders were arrested and exiled. Still, many women in Tunisia wear the headscarf despite its ban in public places. Enforced secularism never succeeded in stamping out religiosity. Democracy will inevitably bring Islamist groups into Tunisia's political mainstream. A few conservative voices have already made rumblings about revising aspects of the Personal Status Code, whereas moderate Islamists are quick to express support for women's rights and adherence to the current code. Rachid Ghannouchi, head of the formerly banned Islamist party Nahda, was once critical of the Personal Status Code and the country's anti-polygamy laws on religious grounds, but by the late 1980s he had come to terms with it. He recently returned to Tunisia after exile in London and has again reaffirmed his support for women's rights. The question is whether Ghannouchi's brand of moderate Islamism will carry the day in Tunisia. In Egypt, democracy will also create important openings for Islamist groups, especially the Muslim Brotherhood. In a 2007 Gallup survey, 64 percent of Egyptians polled said that sharia should be the only source of law in the country; an additional 24 percent said it should be a source of legislation. (There was little variation by gender.) Still, Egyptians' desire for sharia is balanced by a strong demand for modernization and a distaste for theocracy. Women's rights will be a litmus test for the new government - a sign of where the country is headed. The Muslim Brotherhood unleashed a sea of controversy in 2007 when it released its party platform excluding women (and non-Muslims) from the presidency, and calling for a group of Islamic scholars to review and veto legislation that does not conform to religious rules. These conservative positions confirmed critics' worst fears of the Brotherhood, and led to some soul-searching within the organization itself, especially among younger members who disagreed with the hard-line positions of their elders. So far, no women have been named to the small panel revising Egypt's constitution; hence the petition to the ruling Army Council. ""We collected more than 11,000 signatures in a few days,"" http://www.ashoka.org/staff_mena-URL-Iman Bibars, a prominent women's rights activist in Cairo, told me by phone. ""That's a huge number in such a short amount of time."" Bibars is sanguine about prospects for women in the new Egypt, although realistic too. ""We will have to fight for our rights,"" she said. ""It will be tough, and require lobbying, but that's what democracy is all about."" The constitutional reform process presents challenges for women's rights. Some role for sharia is inevitable in the new Egyptian constitution, as the existing one already establishes Islamic law as the main source of legislation. The real issue is what kind of Islam will exert most influence. The rise of Salafism, a particularly conservative form of the faith propagated by Saudi Arabia, should worry Egyptian women's groups. In recent years, tensions between secularists and Salafis have been rising, with Salafis calling for full veiling of women and gender segregation in universities. The Salafis' following is evident in the rising number of Egyptian women wearing the niqab, the face-covering veil, long black abayas and even gloves on their hands to avoid physical contact with men. Wearing the veil has become popular in Tunisia and Egypt for a variety of reasons, including as an expression of religious identity, conforming to social pressures and as a statement against the secular authoritarianism of the government. (The irony is that Egypt is the birthplace of Arab feminism, which in the first half of the 20th century put much energy into unveiling women.) With Hosni Mubarak gone, activists will now have to contend with hard-core politics in a way that has been missing from Egypt's Potemkin parliament. Controversial legislation, like the equal right to divorce that was passed in 2000, will come under pressure from Islamist lawmakers who fiercely opposed the bill. (Tunisia is the only other Arab country that grants women the right.) Women's groups can no longer fall back upon a sympathetic Mubarak regime, which often sided with their cause. In a more fluid democratic system, women's groups in Tunisia and Egypt will have to forge alliances with moderate religious leaders who promote progressive interpretations of sharia. Women's groups in countries such as Morocco, Jordan and, to some extent, Iran have succeeded in doing so, harnessing critical support on legislation affecting their rights. If a brave new world of electoral politics does emerge, women's rights activists will have to be savvy - commanding international support without raising fears of undue Western influence. When women in Iraq and Afghanistan, for example, have faced disastrous rollbacks of their rights in the name of religion, they have called in the international media and shamed their governments into backing down. Tunisian and Egyptian activists should know that women's rights often become bargaining chips for some other agenda. In Iraq, the American-appointed Governing Council wasted no time in trying to rescind the Baathists' progressive family law and replace it with religious law. Only a backlash from women's groups, and a U.S. veto, prevented the move. In the months ahead, women in Tunisia and Egypt must be ready to face similar watershed moments. icoleman@cfr.org Isobel Coleman is a senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations and the author of http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1400066956?ie=UTF8&tag=slatmaga-20&linkCode=as2 &camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=1400066956-URL-""Paradise Beneath Her Feet: How Women are Transforming the Middle East.""

"WP",2011,"Afghanistan","Lara Croft,the NavySEAL? Maybe someday.","On May 3, two days after Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. Special Forces, Stephen Colbert celebrated the terrorist's assassination as only a true pop culture patriot could. ""I want to personally congratulate the guys who got 'er done: SEAL Team 6!"" Colbert brayed, jabbing the air with his fingers for emphasis. ""Their identities are classified, so I'm just gonna guess it's Rambo, John McClane, Master Chief, the Batman, Vin Diesel, Lara Croft and, let's say, Kung Fu Panda."" A few quibbles: ""The Batman"" is a moniker usually uttered by the superhero's enemies, not his allies. Most important, Lara Croft wouldn't be allowed to participate. She is, after all, a woman. The policy against women assigned to ground combat units has been in effect since the beginning of the U.S. military. (Regulations forbidding women to serve as crew members of planes and ships engaged in combat weren't even lifted until the mid-'90s.) But as circumstances change - asymmetric wars in Iraq and Afghanistan; higher numbers, expanding opportunities and growing visibility of women in uniform - it's becoming increasingly clear that the next blow against the military's bulletproof glass ceiling will be directed against the ban on women in Special Forces. This point was underscored almost three weeks ago when, in the middle of the night, a 79-person team made up of CIA operatives, intelligence experts and aforementioned Special Forces soldiers executed a successful raid on bin Laden's suburban Pakistani hideout. Although President Obama, CIA Director Leon Panetta and the roughly two dozen Navy SEALs who participated in the raid have received most of the adulation, there was most likely a significant female element to the operation. ""I can guarantee you that women were involved,"" says Kirsten Holmstedt, author of ""Band of Sisters: American Women at War in Iraq."" Paula Broadwell, an Army reservist with experience in special ops and author of an upcoming biography on her mentor, Gen. David H. Petraeus, agrees: ""Most likely they weren't the helo pilots, and they definitely weren't the SEALs, but they were probably involved in the planning, in CIA operations on the ground and other important roles."" Last year, a pilot program of ""cultural support teams"" was instituted to begin integrating women into higher-risk support roles among special ops forces in Afghanistan. The Pentagon refuses to comment on what roles, if any, women might have played in the Abbottabad raid. Rules and reasons For years, female service members - and the Defense Department itself - have been able to get around the prohibition against women in combat. In Iraq and Afghanistan, it is taboo for Muslim women to interact closely with adult males outside their family, and thus American women have acted as intermediaries for their male counterparts. Female service members are also overseeing checkpoints, interacting with members of local communities and gathering intelligence. There are also all-female teams, sometimes called ""lioness teams"" or ""forward engagement teams,"" who pair up with infantry and, if circumstances demand, bust out the big guns. But all is not fair in war. The justifications used to keep women out of combat and special ops units are the same paternalistic, discriminatory excuses used in favor of upholding racial segregation in the military and, more recently, the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding gays and lesbians. In short, they have little to do with individual capability and reveal far more about ingrained ideas and misconceptions regarding psychology, sexuality and physiology. Naysayers such as Elaine Donnelly of the Center for Military Readiness often bring up the concept of unit cohesion. Women, it's said, would threaten the military's very special fraternity and detract from a unit's preparedness: Consensual sex would be both a temptation and a distraction, and men would be more likely to put themselves at risk to serve (or save) a female colleague. Nancy Duff Campbell, of the National Women's Law Center, says this isn't true. Campbell helped with a 2010 report, commissioned by the Pentagon, that advocates an end to all women-in-combat restrictions because there ""isn't any evidence,"" in her words, that men are trying to protect their fellow female service members more than their male peers. ""Everybody is trying to protect everybody else."" Society's supposed squeamishness with the idea of women coming home in body bags is another reason given. But the reality doesn't support that. Women have been engaged in combat (and have suffered casualties) in other countries for decades, including Germany, Sweden, France and New Zealand. And as Broadwell points out, American women have been seriously injured and killed in Iraq and Afghanistan - more than a hundred fatalities during the last decade. ""A dead soldier is a dead soldier,"" she says. ""It's a tragedy whenever the military loses someone. But that's a poor excuse for limiting my opportunities."" More compelling is the threat of sexual assault. According to the Pentagon, the U.S. armed forces received more than 3,100 reports of assault and rape of service members by other service members in 2010; only 25 percent of those occurred in a combat zone. And those are just the ones we know about. The department estimates that a staggering 80 to 90 percent of sexual assaults go unreported because of fear of ostracism and career sabotage. But this is a problem that the military leadership need to deal with. ""Again, it comes back to, why are you punishing me?"" says Broadwell. ""The problem with assault in the military is a legitimate one, but I don't think it's a reason to preclude an opportunity for women in special ops."" Lastly, and perhaps most convincingly, there are the physical requirements. Special ops forces such as those in the SEAL program have to pass a screening test and then go through the notoriously difficult, six-month-long BUD/S (which stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL) training that has a staggeringly high attrition rate even among males. (About 80 percent of applicants drop out before training is completed.) But standards of physical fitness in women are rising rapidly. Joseph Collins, a former Army colonel and professor of national security strategy at the National War College, says that while teaching at West Point, although he and his fellow instructors could identify differences between men and women on physical tests, they were surprised by how quickly female athletic performance increased over time. ""Men do sort of have an absolute advantage over women in, say, upper-body strength, but the extent to which that really makes sense as an issue, I don't know,"" he says. ""My sense is that there are some women who would love to challenge the forces and see if they could get through. And I know some who are so fit that they probably could."" ""The physical requirements are extreme,"" concedes Lory Manning, a retired Navy captain and the director of the Women in the Military project of the Women's Research and Education Institute. ""But I know some women who could probably meet them, some very strong and fit women. Remember, we used to think women couldn't go into space."" Manning and Collins make a point of emphasizing that, if and when women are allowed to undergo BUD/S training, they'll have to be held to the same physical standards as their male counterparts. Otherwise, Manning says dryly, ""it would just be the ladies' auxiliary."" A matter of time Of course, one woman has made it through BUD/S: ""G.I. Jane's"" Demi Moore. The 1997 film, directed by Ridley Scott (""Alien,"" ""Thelma & Louise""), chronicles the story of a fictional Navy officer named Jordan O'Neil, who is handpicked by an ambitious Texas senator to undergo SEAL training as a sort of test case. (In true Hollywood fashion, Jordan stumbles a bit along the way but eventually triumphs over both the physical challenges and her male peers' antagonistic posturing.) ""I'll admit that Ridley and Demi and I engaged in a bit of wish fulfillment when we made the movie,"" says one of the film's screenwriters, David Twohy. ""Did we really think it was 100 percent feasible (and desirable) that women serve as Navy SEALs? Probably not. But we did think the time had come for a dramatic discussion of the issue, and we thought it because history was clearly showing us the way."" Although there's no record of a woman ever challenging her exclusion from special ops training, it's probably only a matter of time before that happens. The Military Leadership Diversity Commission released a recommendation that the Pentagon open up all military specialties to both genders. And last September, Defense Secretary Robert Gates told an audience of students at Duke University that he expects the ban on women in special ops forces will be lifted at some unspecified point in the future. (The Navy's ban on women serving on submarines was rescinded in April 2010; earlier this month, the first female officers selected for submarine duty reported to a Navy base in Groton, Conn.) The question is: When will the Pentagon lead the way? What's more likely, says Brenda Feigen, an attorney, film producer (1990's ""Navy Seals"") and longtime feminist activist, is that the ban on women in combat and special ops forces will be overturned by the courts. ""I just don't see the Navy or Air Force or the Army willingly letting this happen,"" she says. ""The challenge is for someone to step up and say, 'I'll be qualified to serve as a SEAL if you agree to train me.' "" (In the late 1970s, a lawsuit was filed by active-duty Navy women to open noncombatant ships to females; they won.) ""I don't see this changing in the near future,"" says Rep. Loretta Sanchez (D-Calif.), a senior member of the House Armed Services Committee. ""Most of the men on the committee start out with the idea that women are just weaker. They just think, 'What if something like Black Hawk Down happens? Then our women will be subjected to terrible things.' Well, women are soldiers and are being subjected to terrible things today."" Adds Broadwell, who graduated first in her class at West Point and attempted to gain admission to the Army's Ranger School to ""make a point"": ""There's an institutional obstacle. [The department is] probably happy to have the inertia because this will be a painful process, and there'll be a national argument."" Sanchez, who introduced a bill that would end the ban on women in combat, is quick to note that progress has already been made. When she began serving on the Armed Services Committee in the mid-'90s, she explains, many of the arguments among policymakers revolved around getting rid of women in the military altogether. And her interest in opening up all areas of the military to women is less about ideological point-scoring than ensuring that women are able to reach their full career potential. ""From a promotion standpoint, women don't stand a chance against guys who are able to write on their resumes that they were in combat,"" she says. ""Fifty-two percent of the U.S. population is female, so if that's the case, then why would we shut them out from the very beginning?"" ""It's a very old story,"" adds Collins, the former colonel, who points out that women have been engaging in skirmishes since World War II, when even nurses saw action. ""As far as I'm concerned, it's a chapter that's closed; women have proved themselves in combat."" Seizing the opportunity Now it's time for the men to step up - namely, the generals, congressmen and the next defense secretary (President Obama has nominated Panetta to succeed Gates). As Broadwell emphasizes, it's the older military leadership, not the combat units themselves - ""the special ops community is really forward-leaning on this,"" she says - who are standing in the way. Will it take five years? Twenty? The answer probably lies somewhere in between. But there's a very real prospect that a generation of young women inspired by the SEALs' latest success will one day enjoy the opportunity to be them; it could be one of those heady moments in history when the recent past and advancing future are in almost equal focus. Make no mistake: Those young women are out there. ""If there's a group of women who can show they can pass the screening and want to be subjected to that type of lifestyle, then that's their right as an American citizen,"" concedes Howard Wasdin, a former Team 6 member and author of ""SEAL Team Six: Memoirs of an Elite Navy SEAL Sniper."" ""The Christian side of me would say that being that type of warrior is best suited to a man."" He pauses. ""But you catch me in the unique position of having an 18-year-old daughter. I would say she deserves every opportunity."" style@washpost.com","On May 3, two days after  was killed by  Special Forces, Stephen  celebrated the terrorist's assassination as only a true pop culture patriot could. ""I want to personally congratulate the guys who got 'er done: SEAL Team 6!""  brayed, jabbing the air with his fingers for emphasis. ""Their identities are classified, so I'm just gonna guess it's Rambo, , Master Chief, the Batman, ,  and, let's say, Kung Fu Panda."" A few quibbles: ""The Batman"" is a moniker usually uttered by the superhero's enemies, not his allies. Most important,  wouldn't be allowed to participate. She is, after all, a woman. The policy against women assigned to ground combat units has been in effect since the beginning of the  military. (Regulations forbidding women to serve as crew members of planes and ships engaged in combat weren't even lifted until the mid-'90s.) But as circumstances change - asymmetric wars in  and ; higher numbers, expanding opportunities and growing visibility of women in uniform - it's becoming increasingly clear that the next blow against the military's bulletproof glass ceiling will be directed against the ban on women in Special Forces. This point was underscored almost three weeks ago when, in the middle of the night, a 79-person team made up of  operatives, intelligence experts and aforementioned Special Forces soldiers executed a successful raid on bin Laden's suburban Pakistani hideout. Although President ,  Director  and the roughly two dozen  SEALs who participated in the raid have received most of the adulation, there was most likely a significant female element to the operation. ""I can guarantee you that women were involved,"" says , author of ""Band of Sisters:  Women at War in ."" Paula , an  reservist with experience in special ops and author of an upcoming biography on her mentor, Gen. , agrees: ""Most likely they weren't the helo pilots, and they definitely weren't the SEALs, but they were probably involved in the planning, in  operations on the ground and other important roles."" Last year, a pilot program of ""cultural support teams"" was instituted to begin integrating women into higher-risk support roles among special ops forces in . The  refuses to comment on what roles, if any, women might have played in the  raid. Rules and reasons For years, female service members - and the  itself - have been able to get around the prohibition against women in combat. In  and , it is taboo for Muslim women to interact closely with adult males outside their family, and thus  women have acted as intermediaries for their male counterparts. Female service members are also overseeing checkpoints, interacting with members of local communities and gathering intelligence. There are also all-female teams, sometimes called ""lioness teams"" or ""forward engagement teams,"" who pair up with infantry and, if circumstances demand, bust out the big guns. But all is not fair in war. The justifications used to keep women out of combat and special ops units are the same paternalistic, discriminatory excuses used in favor of upholding racial segregation in the military and, more recently, the ""don't ask, don't tell"" policy regarding gays and lesbians. In short, they have little to do with individual capability and reveal far more about ingrained ideas and misconceptions regarding psychology, sexuality and physiology. Naysayers such as  of the Center for Military Readiness often bring up the concept of unit cohesion. Women, it's said, would threaten the military's very special fraternity and detract from a unit's preparedness: Consensual sex would be both a temptation and a distraction, and men would be more likely to put themselves at risk to serve (or save) a female colleague. , of the National Women's Law Center, says this isn't true.  helped with a 2010 report, commissioned by the , that advocates an end to all women-in-combat restrictions because there ""isn't any evidence,"" in her words, that men are trying to protect their fellow female service members more than their male peers. ""Everybody is trying to protect everybody else."" 's supposed squeamishness with the idea of women coming home in body bags is another reason given. But the reality doesn't support that. Women have been engaged in combat (and have suffered casualties) in other countries for decades, including , ,  and . And as  points out,  women have been seriously injured and killed in  and  - more than a hundred fatalities during the last decade. ""A dead soldier is a dead soldier,"" she says.

"NYT",2012,"France","Lessons Learned: How to Live la Vie Parisienne","''Lessons From Madame Chic: The Top 20 Things I Learned While Living in Paris.'' By Jennifer L. Scott. 212 pages. Published by Jennifer L. Scott, on Amazon.com. $12.99. ''Paris Versus New York: A Tally of Two Cities.'' By Vahram Muratyan. 224 pages. Penguin. $20. YOU can knot a silk scarf around your neck, bob your hair and pop a beret on your head; but if you really want to live la vie Parisienne, Jennifer Scott writes in her book, ''Lessons From Madame Chic: The Top 20 Things I Learned While Living in Paris,'' such surface flourishes won't do the trick. No, if you wish to exude the allure of Frenchwomen from Gigi to Jeanne Moreau to Charlotte Gainsbourg, you must learn to conduct yourself as if you were being surveilled by a critical Parisian matron -- the sort of woman who would arch an eyebrow in horror if she caught you rooting in a can of Pringles, or sauntering to the mailbox in leggings and a T-shirt. Yes, the author admits, you must suffer to be French. If you do, you may discover, as she did, that it's worth it. In her words: ''you do not have to be on vacation in a romantic, foreign city to live a life of rapture.'' Ms. Scott, a bubbly young wife and mother from Santa Monica, Calif., came of age as a laid-back American girl, fond of sugary, greasy treats like ''drug store candy'' and ''potato chips out of the bag'' and (perhaps as a result) obsessed with skin care. But when she spent a collegiate year in Paris a decade ago, dividing her time between two French host families presided over by women she nicknames ''Madame Chic'' and ''Madame Bohemienne,'' the experience transformed her. She determined that her skin would glow healthily if she ate proper multicourse meals ''with a knife and fork'' instead of scarfing down carbs on the run; and that she would look more polished if she threw out ''70 percent'' of the vast supply of disposable clothing she had amassed since her teens and winnowed her core wardrobe to 10 good-quality items each season. Back in America in 2008, Ms. Scott created the blog ''The Daily Connoisseur'' in which she reminisces about her Gallic immersion, and offers tips on how to achieve an elegant routine on home turf. Last year, she folded together many of the blog entries into her book -- now fluttering high on Amazon's Paris Top 10 list -- as a guide for women who, like herself, yearn to channel Audrey Tautou in the American suburbs. Personable, anecdote-filled and studded with lifestyle tips, ''Lessons From Madame Chic'' could have used spell-check and a quick edit, but its vivacity and sincerity have struck a chord among women who would like a French role model of their own, but don't have a year to spend apprenticing with one in Paris. In the chapter ''Look Presentable Always,'' Ms. Scott notes with awe that her aristocratic hostess, Madame Chic, was faultlessly attired even at 5:30 in the morning, when she rose to prepare her daily tartine (with homemade preserves). Early in Ms. Scott's stay, when she moseyed into the kitchen in ratty white sweatpants with a hole in the knee (her favorite sleepwear), Madame Chic, scandalized, asked, ''Why would you keep them?'' Ms. Scott promptly threw them out and bought proper pajamas. ''This was the first time I respected myself enough to realize I deserved to wear beautiful and feminine articles of clothing -- at all times -- not just during the day or on special occasions,'' she writes. Quickly, she concluded that California casual was ''way too casual''; and that letting it all hang out had deprived her American life of joie de vivre. Even in the more relaxed household of ''Madame Bohemienne,'' certain standards were nonnegotiable. The lady of the house cultivated ''Le No Makeup Look,'' which her American ward instantly adopted. Ms. Scott provides a thorough how-to section in the book, explaining that French women manage the look, ''polished but not in an overt, contrived way'' by using subtle-unto-invisible foundation and a neutral lip color, and discreetly bumping it up a notch either with a ''defined eye'' or with a ''defined lip,'' but rarely with both. The Parisian men Ms. Scott met were similarly ''well groomed, well shod and well mannered.'' Monsieur Chic once apologized to his guest, when she caught him smoking a pipe and watching television news with his shirt untucked. Retucking his shirt, he apologized ''profusely.'' It never happened again. Ms. Scott adds, ''They weren't putting on airs for me''; this was their ''normal.'' Like her hostess, Ms. Scott learned to choose baguette over bagel and to shun the Dorito. Another globe-trotting Francophile bloggeur, the Parisian graphic designer Vahram Muratyan, has created a still speedier shortcut to demonstrate the contrasts between French and American culture; though he does not privilege one over the other. In his witty, high-concept, high-colored flipbook ''Paris Versus New York: A Tally of Two Cities'' (which began as parisvsnyc.blogspot.com), Mr. Muratyan uses splashy collagist art to showcase the visual beauty marks of the two metropolises. In a layout called ''le temple,'' he pairs I. M. Pei's glass pyramid at the Louvre in Paris with the glass cube at Apple's consumerist shrine near Central Park. In another called ''le snack,'' he pits the Parisian toasted ham-and-cheese ''croque-monsieur'' against the New York hot dog. He does it with stripes: on the top half of one page, ochre, saffron and pale pink define the French sandwich. Below it, stripes continue, delineating the kosher frank -- pale beige bands of bun flanking a bright red stripe with a mustard-yellow meander. Other pages set Edith Piaf against Barbra Streisand (''la drama queen''); Champagne flutes against a red Solo cup (''la fete''); and Jennifer Scott's beloved Amelie (played by Audrey Tautou) against New Yorkers' beloved Carrie (''la romantique''), of ''Sex and the City.'' Category by category, Mr. Muratyan invites readers to play an entertaining guessing game as they decode his apt juxtapositions. His thesis emerges playfully on every page: Vive la difference.","''Lessons From Madame Chic: The Top 20 Things I Learned While Living in .'' By . 212 pages. Published by , on . $12.99.

"NYT",2012,"France","Live Coverage: U.S. 4, France 2","The opening ceremony is still two days away, but Olympic sport began today, with six women's soccer matches. Here's how The Times described a pulsating game in Glasgow, live as it happened. Final | U.S. 4, France 2 A barn burner in Glasgow. The United States has to be extremely pleased with its comeback. The team should cruise to a group victory now. then, as in every major tournament, the real work will begin in the knockout rounds. Sam Borden's game story from the scene will be posted soon. Cheerio! Minute 88 | France Still Game Thomis gets loose on a counter, but can't really handle the ball running at top speed, and it goes to Solo. While France hasn't really looked like scoring again, they are still trying to create. Minute 85 | The Captain Takes a Seat The game's final sub, Sydney Leroux, comes in for captain Rapinoe. Minute 82 | Aggressive France Despite being underdogs, France has played aggressively against the mighty Americans.  At this writing, they have 9 shots to the Americans' 8, and 6 corners to the Americans' 5. Even now, they are trying to create, but they are going to need more U.S. errors to have any chance of a comeback of their own. Minute 77 | Job for Solo And that's all for two-goal scorer Alex Morgan. Amy Shilling takes her place. France follows with an optimistic long ball, which keeper Solo leaps for. 74 Minute | Tough Nut for France to Crack Final sub for France. Sandrine Soubeyrand in for Abily. France is not quitting by any means, but the American midfielders and defense are not letting them have anything right now. Minute 68 | Gooooool! The U.S. is Up 4-2. France, with fewer players at the back, breaks down defensively and Alex Morgan gets her second goal with an easy unmarked tap-in at the post. After the stunningly poor start, the U.S. rally has been extremely efficient. Minute 65 | Not Make or Break In Coventry, Canada has pulled to within 2-1, bidding to upset Japan. Don't forget that with 8 of 12 teams advancing to the quarterfinals, no team will be crippled by a loss today. It does beat women's water polo, where 8 of 8 teams advance. (!)

"NYT",2009,"Iraq","Living and Fighting Alongside Men, and Fitting In","-- There is no mistaking that this dusty, gravel-strewn camp northeast of Baghdad is anything other than a combat outpost in a still-hostile land. And there is no mistaking that women in uniform have had a transformative effect on it. They have their own quarters, boxy trailers called CHUs (the military's acronym for containerized housing units, pronounced ''chews''). There are women's bathrooms and showers, alongside the men's. Married couples live together. The base's clinic treats gynecological problems and has, alongside the equipment needed to treat the trauma of modern warfare, an ultrasound machine. Opponents of integrating women in combat zones long feared that sex would mean the end of American military prowess. But now birth control is available -- the PX at Warhorse even sold out of condoms one day recently -- reflecting a widely accepted reality that soldiers have sex at outposts across Iraq. The wars in Iraq and Afghanistan are the first in which tens of thousands of American military women have lived, worked and fought with men for prolonged periods. Wars without front lines, they have done more than just muddle the rules meant to keep women out of direct enemy contact. They have changed the way the United States military goes to war. They have reshaped life on bases across Iraq and Afghanistan. They have cultivated a new generation of women with a warrior's ethos -- and combat experience -- that for millennia was almost exclusively the preserve of men. And they have done so without the disruption of discipline and unit cohesion that some feared would unfold at places like Warhorse. ''There was a lot of debate over where women should be,'' said Brig. Gen. Heidi V. Brown, one of the two highest ranking women in Iraq today, recalling the start of the war. ''Here we are six years later, and you don't hear about it. You shouldn't hear about it.'' In many ways, General Brown's career trajectory since the war began reflects the expanded role for women at war. In 2003, as a colonel, she commanded a Patriot air-defense brigade that joined the push from Kuwait to Baghdad, losing nine soldiers in a maintenance battalion outside Nasiriya three days after the invasion began. One of them, Pfc. Lori Ann Piestewa, was the first woman killed in action in Iraq; Pfc. Jessica D. Lynch was captured in the same attack. Now, as the American role in the war declines, General Brown will oversee the logistics of withdrawing the vast amounts of military hardware in Iraq over the next year. ''We've needed -- needed -- the contributions of both our men and women,'' said Brig. Gen. Mary A. Legere, the director of intelligence for the American war effort here and the other highest ranking woman in Iraq. The military, of course, is not gender blind, especially in a war zone. Sexual harassment in a still-predominantly male institution remains a problem. So does sexual assault. Both are underreported, soldiers and officers here say, because the rigidity of the military chain of command can make accusations uncomfortable and even risky for victims living in close quarters with the men they accuse. As a precaution, women are advised to travel in pairs, particularly in smaller bases populated with Iraqi troops and civilians. Capt. Margaret D. Taafe-McMenamy, commander of the intelligence analysis cell at Warhorse, carries a folding knife and a heavy, ridged flashlight -- a Christmas gift from her husband, whom she lives with here -- as a precaution when she is out at night on the base. Staff Sgt. Patricia F. Bradford, 27, a psychological operations soldier, said that slights, subtle and not, were common, and some were easier to brush off than others. Women are still viewed derisively at times in the confined, occasionally tense space of an outpost like Warhorse. ''You're a bitch, a slut or a dyke -- or you're married, but even if you're married, you're still probably one of the three,'' Sergeant Bradford said. At the same time, she and other female soldiers cope with the slights, showing a disarming brashness. ''I think being a staff sergeant -- and a bitch -- helps deflect those things,'' she added. The issues that arise in having women in combat -- harassment, bias, hardship, even sexual relations -- are, she and others said, a matter of discipline, maturity and professionalism rather than an argument for separating the sexes. Sergeant Bradford recalled the day during her first tour when her convoy moved south while a soldier with whom she was then engaged to be married moved north on the same highway. She listened on the radio as his convoy came under an attack that continued after she was out of range. ''For four days, I had no idea what happened to him,'' she said, ''but I still had to continue my mission, because that's what you do when you're a soldier.'' (He emerged unscathed, she later learned.) Unforeseen Issues Such issues were not foreseen when the war in Iraq began in 2003, even though the initial invasion force included women in the vanguard. On a practical level, the military was not prepared to house and otherwise address the specific needs of women in a war zone -- including issues like health and privacy. Early on, bases were largely makeshift and far more dangerous. Few soldiers, male or female, had more than rudimentary quarters or latrines. None had much privacy. Sgt. Dawn M. Cloukey, a communications specialist, spent her first tour in Iraq in 2005 and 2006 as the only woman among 45 soldiers, operating a retransmission station in the mountains of northern Iraq and then in the center of Baghdad. She lived out of a rucksack, with no toilet or room of her own. She described the experience as isolating. ''I always felt like the plague,'' she said at Warhorse, on her second tour in Iraq, where she handles communications for the commander of the First Stryker Brigade of the 25th Infantry Division. As the United States military settled into more permanent bases, many initial difficulties abated, as the Army gradually adapted to the new reality of waging war with a mixed force. So have the soldiers themselves. Women have sought acceptance in a still-predominately male environment not by emphasizing their sex but rather by displaying their toughness, their willingness to adjust to conditions that are less than ideal. ''I've kicked my guys out of the truck to pee in a bottle like that,'' Sgt. Joelene M. Lachance, a soldier with the 172nd Military Intelligence Battalion, said at Warhorse, pointing to one of the liter water bottles that are ubiquitous at bases in Iraq. ''Cut the bottle off and pee in the bottle and then dispose of it. Sometimes it's an issue, but most of the time, I just make do. ''I don't try to, like, 'I can't sleep here,' '' she continued. ''If they're sleeping there, I'm sleeping there. I spent five days out in the truck once -- with six of my guys, sleeping on the floor.'' Warhorse still reverberates with the rumble of armored convoys and the thud of helicopters ferrying troops and, at times, the wounded. It is just north of Baquba, the regional capital of Diyala Province, one of the most restive provinces in Iraq. Here, the war is not over. Warhorse will very likely be among the last bases to close in Iraq before American troops withdraw in full. At the outset of the war, the introduction of women into outposts like Warhorse raised fears not justof abuse or harassment, but also of sex and pregnancy. The worst of those fears, officers say, have not materialized. In fact, sex in America's war zones is fairly common, soldiers say, and has not generally proved disruptive. In April, the latest iteration of General Order No. 1, the rules governing the behavior of soldiers in Iraq broadly, quietly relaxed the explicit prohibition on sex in a war zone, though it still bars sex with Iraqis and spending the night in someone else's CHU. Some commands, including Baghdad, retain broader restrictions, for example, on being in CHUs belonging to members of the opposite sex. ''The chain of command already has to deal with enough,'' Captain Taafe-McMenamy said. ''They don't really want to have to punish soldiers for dating.'' Women do become pregnant -- a condition that, intentional or not, in or out of wedlock, requires the woman to be flown out within two weeks, causing personnel disruptions in individual units. The Army and Marine Corps declined to say exactly how many women left Iraq and Afghanistan as a result of pregnancies, but it appears to be relatively rare and has had little effect on overall readiness, commanders say. At Warhorse, the First Stryker Brigade, which has thousands of soldiers, has sent only three women home because of pregnancies in 10 months in Iraq, the brigade said. ''There was a fear if we integrate units, you will have a bunch of young people with raging hormones, and it will end up in too many unwanted pregnancies, and it's more trouble than it's worth,'' said Peter Mansoor, a former battalion commander in Iraq who, until retiring recently, served as Gen. David H. Petraeus's executive officer. ''With good leadership and mentorship, we have been able to keep those problems to a minimum.'' Taking On New Roles Roughly 1 in 20 of the 5,600 soldiers at Warhorse is female, a smaller ratio than in the military as a whole. Nonetheless, they are fully integrated in the base's operations. Many of the women at Warhorse serve in jobs that have traditionally accommodated women: the base hospital, food service, supply and administration. Others, though, serve on the brigade staff, in intelligence and psychological operations, which until recently were part of the Special Forces and thus off limits to women. ''We have changed so much,'' Col. Burt K. Thompson, the commander at Warhorse, said of the Army, noting that every time he leaves the base, his patrol includes two women, including Sergeant Cloukey ''on comms'' -- communications -- and a medic, Sgt. Evette T. Lee-Stewart. ''To have a female on an infantry brigade staff? Oh my God.'' Like many commanders who have served in Iraq or Afghanistan, he said that women have ended the debate over their role by their performance. ''I've relieved males from command,'' he said. ''I've never relieved a female commander in two and a half years as commander.'' The nature of the war has also done much to change the debate over combat roles. Any trip off the heavily secured bases now effectively invites contact with the enemy. Many women have also been pulled off their regular jobs and trained to search Iraqi women at checkpoints because of local cultural sensitivities, putting them as much at risk as any male counterpart. When Specialist Jennifer M. Hoeppner goes ''outside the wire'' at Warhorse, as going on patrol is known, she clambers into what she calls ''the best seat in the truck,'' the turret atop the Army's newest armored vehicle, the MRAP. ''I'm the gunner on all our missions,'' she said, having qualified for the M240B machine gun at an expert level. ''I think some of the males are a little confused when I go up,'' Specialist Hoeppner said. ''They're like, 'Who's your gunner?' '' Women are also increasingly ''attached'' to infantry and armored units that train and advise Iraq's police and military forces. Now that almost all American combat forces have pulled back to bases outside of Iraq's cities, that training has become the main mission in Iraq. The involvement of women in it has been a cultural shock for Iraqi men far less accustomed to dealing with women professionally, especially in the military. Women spoke of inappropriate comments or uncomfortable flattery, and even gifts. ''It was everything from candy to lingerie,'' said Capt. Victoria Ferreira, 29, who spent a year with an 11-person squad training Iraqi officers. ''How do you react to that? 'Thank you?' '' For the most part, though, Iraqis seem to accept the role of women in the American military -- they have even expanded their own ranks for tasks like searching women at checkpoints -- even if it seems unlikely that women will be incorporated more widely into the Iraqi armed forces anytime soon. ''I think now, six years since the war started, they've learned to adapt or tolerate the fact that in the American Army we have high ranking positions that are filled by women,'' said Capt. Violeta Z. Sifuentes, who commands the 591st Military Police Company. It was not always so, she recalled of her first tour in Samarra in 2006. ''They always thought my platoon sergeant or my squad leader was the one in charge until I was like, 'Listen here. I'm in charge whether you like it or not.' '' The captain's remarks were typical. The women serving in today's military represent a generational shift. They are confident young women who have not had to fight the same gender battles their predecessors in uniform did. ''I never felt like I had to fight to succeed in the Army'' was how Captain Taafe-McMenamy, who is 27, put it. Adapting to the Tasks Women in today's military say they do not feel the same pressure to prove themselves.  They adapt and expect others to adapt. They preserve their femininity without making much of it. Specialist Hoeppner and her roommate, Sergeant Bradford, belong to the 361st Tactical Psychological Operations Company, which patrols the towns and villages of Diyala with infantry squads to spread and collect information. On a recent patrol in the small village of Shifta, they seemed more of a novelty to the Iraqis they encountered than the soldiers they patrolled with, taking up defensive positions alongside their male colleagues whenever they paused. ''I actually had this million-dollar idea my first deployment,'' Sergeant Bradford said of her tour as a truck driver hauling supplies in 2004. ''I was like, I need something that's like a beer bong that I can hold in place so I can pee standing up without pulling my pants down. Cause we were truck drivers. We'd stop on the side of the road. There's no bushes. I was telling one of my soldiers about this great idea, and he said they already make that.'' She produced from her bunk in her CHU a device sold by REI called a ''feminine urinary director.'' ''It's even pink,'' Specialist Hoeppner interjected. Warhorse's supply officer -- a woman -- acquired dozens of them. ''The first time one of them came around a truck and saw me peeing on a tire,'' she said of one of her male colleagues, ''I thought he was going to have a heart attack.'' Articles in this series explore how the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have profoundly redefined the role of women in the military.

At the outset of the war, the introduction of women into outposts like Warhorse raised fears not justof abuse or harassment, but also of sex and pregnancy. The worst of those fears, officers say, have not materialized. In fact, sex in America's war zones is fairly common, soldiers say, and has not generally proved disruptive. In April, the latest iteration of General Order No. 1, the rules governing the behavior of soldiers in  broadly, quietly relaxed the explicit prohibition on sex in a war zone, though it still bars sex with is and spending the night in someone else's CHU. Some commands, including , retain broader restrictions, for example, on being in CHUs belonging to members of the opposite sex. ''The chain of command already has to deal with enough,'' Captain Taafe-McMenamy said. ''They don't really want to have to punish soldiers for dating.'' Women do become pregnant -- a condition that, intentional or not, in or out of wedlock, requires the woman to be flown out within two weeks, causing personnel disruptions in individual units. The  and Marine Corps declined to say exactly how many women left  and  as a result of pregnancies, but it appears to be relatively rare and has had little effect on overall readiness, commanders say. At Warhorse, the , which has thousands of soldiers, has sent only three women home because of pregnancies in 10 months in , the brigade said. ''There was a fear if we integrate units, you will have a bunch of young people with raging hormones, and it will end up in too many unwanted pregnancies, and it's more trouble than it's worth,'' said Peter Mansoor, a former battalion commander in  who, until retiring recently, served as Gen. David H. Petraeus's executive officer. ''With good leadership and mentorship, we have been able to keep those problems to a minimum.'' Taking On New Roles Roughly 1 in 20 of the 5,600 soldiers at Warhorse is female, a smaller ratio than in the military as a whole. Nonetheless, they are fully integrated in the base's operations. Many of the women at Warhorse serve in jobs that have traditionally accommodated women: the base hospital, food service, supply and administration. Others, though, serve on the brigade staff, in intelligence and psychological operations, which until recently were part of the Special Forces and thus off limits to women. ''We have changed so much,'' Col. Burt K. Thompson, the commander at Warhorse, said of the , noting that every time he leaves the base, his patrol includes two women, including Sergeant Cloukey ''on comms'' -- communications -- and a medic, Sgt. Evette T. Lee-Stewart. ''To have a female on an infantry brigade staff? Oh my God.'' Like many commanders who have served in  or , he said that women have ended the debate over their role by their performance. ''I've relieved males from command,'' he said. ''I've never relieved a female commander in two and a half years as commander.'' The nature of the war has also done much to change the debate over combat roles. Any trip off the heavily secured bases now effectively invites contact with the enemy. Many women have also been pulled off their regular jobs and trained to search i women at checkpoints because of local cultural sensitivities, putting them as much at risk as any male counterpart. When Specialist Jennifer M. Hoeppner goes ''outside the wire'' at Warhorse, as going on patrol is known, she clambers into what she calls ''the best seat in the truck,'' the turret atop the 's newest armored vehicle, the MRAP. ''I'm the gunner on all our missions,'' she said, having qualified for the M240B machine gun at an expert level. ''I think some of the males are a little confused when I go up,'' Specialist Hoeppner said. ''They're like, 'Who's your gunner?' '' Women are also increasingly ''attached'' to infantry and armored units that train and advise 's police and military forces. Now that almost all American combat forces have pulled back to bases outside of 's cities, that training has become the main mission in . The involvement of women in it has been a cultural shock for i men far less accustomed to dealing with women professionally, especially in the military. Women spoke of inappropriate comments or uncomfortable flattery, and even gifts. ''It was everything from candy to lingerie,'' said Capt. Victoria Ferreira, 29, who spent a year with an 11-person squad training i officers. ''How do you react to that? 'Thank you?' '' For the most part, though, is seem to accept the role of women in the American military -- they have even expanded their own ranks for tasks like searching women at checkpoints -- even if it seems unlikely that women will be incorporated more widely into the i armed forces anytime soon. ''I think now, six years since the war started, they've learned to adapt or tolerate the fact that in the American  we have high ranking positions that are filled by women,'' said Capt. Violeta Z. Sifuentes, who commands the 591st Military Police Company. It was not always so, she recalled of her first tour in Samarra in 2006. ''They always thought my platoon sergeant or my squad leader was the one in charge until I was like, 'Listen here. I'm in charge whether you like it or not.' '' The captain's remarks were typical. The women serving in today's military represent a generational shift. They are confident young women who have not had to fight the same gender battles their predecessors in uniform did. ''I never felt like I had to fight to succeed in the '' was how Captain Taafe-McMenamy, who is 27, put it. Adapting to the Tasks Women in today's military say they do not feel the same pressure to prove themselves.  They adapt and expect others to adapt. They preserve their femininity without making much of it. Specialist Hoeppner and her roommate, Sergeant , belong to the 361st Tactical Psychological Operations Company, which patrols the towns and villages of Diyala with infantry squads to spread and collect information. On a recent patrol in the small village of Shifta, they seemed more of a novelty to the is they encountered than the soldiers they patrolled with, taking up defensive positions alongside their male colleagues whenever they paused. ''I actually had this million-dollar idea my first deployment,'' Sergeant  said of her tour as a truck driver hauling supplies in 2004. ''I was like, I need something that's like a beer bong that I can hold in place so I can pee standing up without pulling my pants down. Cause we were truck drivers. We'd stop on the side of the road. There's no bushes. I was telling one of my soldiers about this great idea, and he said they already make that.'' She produced from her bunk in her CHU a device sold by REI called a ''feminine urinary director.'' ''It's even pink,'' Specialist Hoeppner interjected. Warhorse's supply officer -- a woman -- acquired dozens of them. ''The first time one of them came around a truck and saw me peeing on a tire,'' she said of one of her male colleagues, ''I thought he was going to have a heart attack.''

"NYT",1987,"France","MARGUERITE YOURCENAR, WRITER AND SCHOLAR, DIES","Marguerite Yourcenar, a writer and classical scholar and the first woman to be named to the Academie Francaise, died Thursday night at her home in Northeast Harbor, Me. She was 84 years old. Miss Yourcenar was a cosmopolitan, versatile woman of letters who wrote in her native French. To English-speaking readers, she was best known for her fiction, especially her 1951 novel ''Memoirs of Hadrian.'' Her other writings included essays, memoirs and plays. On hearing of her death, Prime Minister Jacques Chirac of France said yesterday in Paris: ''French letters has just lost an exceptional woman. On the strength of a classical and rigorous style, Marguerite Yourcenar used a very personal tone to find, thanks to history, the occasion for a strong reflection on morality and power.'' 'Words Will Be Read Forever' Roger W. Straus, the president and chief executive officer of Farrar Straus & Giroux, which has published works by Miss Yourcenar, said yesterday in a statement released at the Manhattan headquarters of the publishing house: ''Marguerite Yourcenar was without question or doubt one of the great writers of the 20th century. She is a great loss to the literary community, but her words will be read and remembered forever.'' Born in Brussels of a French father and Belgian mother, Miss Yourcenar grew up in France and traveled widely. On a visit to the United States early in World War II, she decided to stay when, as she once put it, ''the months stretched into years as the war didn't end.'' For the next decade she taught comparative literature at Sarah Lawrence College. She acquired United States citizenship in 1947 but was later reinstated as a citizen of France. ''I am rootless,'' she told an interviewer in 1979. ''To steal from Hadrian, 'I am at home everywhere and nowhere.' '' Her induction into the Academie Francaise in 1981 was an accolade that had been denied to Mme. de Stael, Colette and other illustrious Frenchwomen in the four-century history of that prestigious society of 40 ''immortals,'' the arbiters of French language and literature. 'Let Their Shadows Pass' Commenting on her induction, Miss Yourcenar said: ''This uncertain, floating me, whose existence I myself dispute, here it is, surrounded, accompanied by an invisible troupe of women who perhaps should have received this honor long before, so that I am tempted to stand aside to let their shadows pass.'' She also said the academy was not to blame for not admitting women sooner. ''One cannot say,'' she said, ''that in French society, so impregnated with feminine influences, the academy has been a notable misogynist: it simply conformed to the custom that willingly placed a woman on a pedestal but did not permit itself to officially offer her a chair.'' Miss Yourcenar was respected as a classical scholar as well as a literary stylist. The Oxford University classicist Hugh Lloyd-Jones, writing in The New York Times Book Review in February 1985, praised her ''ornamental and melliflous French prose, studded with the literary allusions which come so easily to such a cultivated writer.'' Mixing Scholarship and Magic Miss Yourcenar once said her writing had ''one foot in scholarship, the other in magic arts,'' and her interests were diverse. Shortly before her death, in an interview with Jean-Pierre Corteggiani for the new quarterly Normal, Miss Yourcenar spoke of her views on literature: ''The books I like best are those where there is intelligence, goodness and no injustice. They are very rare indeed. I think that the reason there is so much bad literature, or at least one of the reasons, is that the average person who sets out to be a writer goes around looking for subjects to write about, and editors have the effrontery to ask you: 'Could you not possibly write a novel about . . . or an essay on . . .,' to which I always reply that I never write anything I have not chosen myself.'' Her works ranged from ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' - an imaginary autobiography of the Roman emperor written as a letter to his grandson Marcus Aurelius - to a volume of stories, ''Oriental Tales'' (first published in 1938 in French), that drew on the folklore of medieval Japan and other cultures. Translated American Spirituals She also wrote plays, poems and prose poems and translated into French the lyrics of American spirituals as well as works by such authors as James Baldwin, the modern Greek poet Constantine Cavafy, Henry James, Thomas Mann, Yukio Mishima and Virginia Woolf. The Hadrian novel was widely considered Miss Yourcenar's magnum opus. The author Stephen Koch wrote in The Times Book Review in September 1985 that the work ''has riches for anyone interested in history, humanism or the psychology of power.'' When it was first published, he recalled, ''it was immediately incrusted with the mixed and marmoreal honor of being called a classic in its own time.'' Miss Yourcenar's criticism was praised by John Gross in The Times. Reviewing the English translation of her book ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi and Other Essays,'' Mr. Gross called her ''an outstanding critic'' and said the essays in the book were notably lucid and ''forceful, deeply pondered, the record of a full imaginative response.'' The rest of her work, which drew on her familiarity with several languages and literatures, remained less widely known until she was named to the Academie Francaise. In subsequent years, translations of her writing came out more frequently. Translations Are Published In April, ''Two Lives and a Dream,'' a volume containing three stories by Miss Yourcenar, was published in an English translation by Walter Kaiser in collaboraton with the author. The book had come out in 1982 in France, and the stories it contained were revisions of writing Miss Yourcenar did decades earlier. Farrar Straus & Giroux is to publish a paperback edition in April. ''Mishima: a Vision of the Void,'' a short study by Miss Yourcenar of the Japanese writer Yukio Mishima, was published here in 1986. Farrar Straus is also scheduled to publish a collection of essays and literary criticism next spring titled ''That Mighty Sculptor, Time.'' In addition, Farrar Straus is to publish three volumes of autobiography by Ms. Yourcenar, but no publication dates have been set. The other books by Miss Yourcenar that have appeared in the United States in English translation include, in addition to ''Memoirs of Hadrian,'' ''Coup de Grace'' (1957), ''The Abyss'' (1976), ''Fires'' (1981), ''A Coin in Nine Hands'' (1982), ''The Dark Brain of Piranesi'' (1984), ''Alexis'' (1984) and ''Oriental Tales'' (1985). Read Racine at 8 Miss Yourcenar was born June 8, 1903, the only child of Michel de Crayencour and the former Fernande de Cartier de Marchienne. The name Yourcenar - which she assumed personally and professionally in the 1920's - is an imperfect anagram of the name Crayencour. Her mother died when Marguerite was less than a month old, and she was educated, largely by tutors, under the direction of her father. As an 8-year-old, she was already reading the work of the 17th-century French dramatist Racine, and as a teen-ager she had two small books of verse published. Then, as an independently wealthy young woman, she traveled widely, wrote essays, poems and fiction, and won praise as a novelist. In 1950, after settling in the United States, Miss Yourcenar and her American friend and companion, Grace Frick, bought the house in Northeast Harbor - on Mount Desert Island off the Maine coast -that became their longtime home. Miss Frick, who translated ''Memoirs of Hadrian'' and other works by Miss Yourcenar into English, died in 1979. Miss Yourcenar was known to have prepared a tombstone for her eventual grave, complete up to the final two digits of the date of her death. In the interview with Normal, Miss Yourcenar said she had met a Frenchwoman who was horrified that she had even put the first two numbers of her death date on the marker. ''So she said 'but why should you not live to the year 2000?' I have absolutely no desire to live till the year 2000,'' Miss Yourcenar said. ''The year 2000 is not for me.'' Miss Yourcenar was awarded honorary degrees by Smith, Bowdoin and Colby colleges. She also won numerous European literary prizes, was decorated by the French and Belgian Governments and was a member of the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters and the Academy of the French Language and Literature of Belgium.

"NYT",1990,"Saudi Arabia","MIDEAST TENSIONS; Saudi Women Take Driver's Seat in a Rare Protest for the Right to Travel","In daring defiance of the Saudi tradition against women driving, about 70 veiled Saudi women gathered on Tuesday in front of a supermarket in Riyadh, dismissed their drivers and drove in a convoy of cars before being stopped and and detained by the police a short time later. Saudis said the demonstration for the right to drive was the first known open protest by Saudi women and an exceedingly rare manifestation of public sentiment in this conservative Islamic nation. Equally startling was that virtually all of the women received the support of their husbands or close male relatives before undertaking the action, several organizers said. Plush Sedans The cars -- about 40 dark, plush Lincoln Continentals, Mercedes-Benzes, Buicks and Japanese luxury sedans -- were intercepted by the Saudi police at intersections after the convoy had broken into smaller groups, about a half-hour after the protest began. Some of the women in the cars refused to lower their windows or communicate with the police before they were taken away. Saudi officials said early this morning that the women had been released after signing a pledge that they would not repeat their action elsewhere. The demonstration came at a time when the presence of American and other Western forces is stirring considerable debate here about whether to bring this country more in tune with the modern world. But many of the women involved in the demonstration were eager to emphasize that it had nothing to do with the large presence of Westerners here since the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait on Aug. 2. The protest was not publicized in advance to Western news organizations. Barred by Tradition Although some Saudi women have pressed for a wider array of rights, organizers said the protest was focused narrowly on the right to drive as a matter of convenience and household economics. Although there is no written law that prevents women from driving here, they are barred by tradition from doing so and must use a paid driver or a relative to go anywhere. Under severe Islamic strictures, Saudi women are veiled and robed from head to toe, forbidden from appearing in public with men and from traveling anywhere without permission from husbands or male relatives. Organizers of the demonstration said many of the women had gotten driver's licenses while in the United States or Europe. They said that many were highly educated and came from prominent families, a factor that may have figured in their treatment by the authorities. It was doubtful, however, that the Saudi authorities would react more harshly because the status of women here, while inferior to men, is also highly protected by tradition and paternalism. No Official Mention The protest became the talk of this the country Tuesday evening, evidently through word of mouth. In phone interviews from places around the country, Saudis used words like ""amazing"" and ""astounding"" to describe the incident. There was no mention of it on any Saudi news reports, however, and many Saudis were certain that the Saudi authorities would suppress any information about it. The organizers said they sent dozens of telegrams to senior Saudi officials explaining that their intention was for the greater good of Saudi Arabia. The incident began late Tuesday afternoon with women, some accompanied by daughters, converging on the Al Tamimi Safeway supermarket parking lot, driven there by their chauffeurs. There, the drivers were left behind as some of the women got into the driver's seats and the rest occupied passenger seats. At least one woman's husband followed in another car from a distance -- for ""moral support,"" he said. 'Couldn't Believe My Ears' ""I couldn't believe my ears when madame asked me for the car keys and told me to get out and then drove away with the others,"" said a Sri Lankan driver who identified himself as T. R. Zein. Another chauffeur, an Indonesian who said his name was Asmara, said his employer brought her 15-year-old daughter along and left the house while her husband was present and presumably informed about her intentions. ""I think he knows,"" the Indonesian man said of the husband. Mr. Zein, who sat on the sidewalk next with about 25 other, mostly Asian drivers, said he drove his employer, whom he described as a 35-year-old schoolteacher, along with her teen-age daughter. ""There were about 40 cars here and they left us all here,"" he said as other drivers nodded. ""They drove together. I think the police caught them later."" 'We Wanted to Be Heard' The Saudi religious police known as the Committee for Commendation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice rounded up all of the cars and the women at intersections. They prevented curious onlookers from approaching an area where they were stopped on King Abdel Aziz Road. The police could be seen asking women to get out from driver's seats and to sit in back seats, as more police cars converged on one site where the women's cars were stopped. The women were deliberately trying to draw attention and fully expected to be arrested, one of the organizers said. ""We wanted to be heard by the authorities, loudly and clearly,"" she said in a telephone interview a few hours later. Later, in separate telephone interviews, two of the women who helped organize the demonstration and who insisted on not being identified explained that they spent a week planning the event. They all agreed that a leading figure behind the protest was Aisha al-Maneh, a sociology professor who received her doctorate from the University of Colorado in Boulder. They described her as an outspoken advocate among hundreds of other educated women in Saudi Arabia who have argued that there were no edicts in Islam that ban women from driving. 'Patriotic' Protest Mrs. Aisha, who taught for some time at the university here before she reportedly quit in frustration over other restrictions imposed on women, could not be reached for comment. The two women who participated in the organization of the demonstration said they meant no harm to Saudi Arabia and strongly defended their action as ""patriotic"" and ""necessary."" ""It is important for the authorities to understand that as educated women who have driven themselves abroad while we pursued graduate studies, we cannot be reduced to being dependent on strangers to drive us,"" said a 36-year-old woman who asked not to be identified by name. ""In addition to being humiliating, this is anti-Islamic,"" she said. ""Islam says that a woman should not be left alone in the company of a man who is not her relative and that is exactly what happens everytime I am driven in my car by a Pakistani, Sudanese or other person who is a driver. Besides, this is very expensive on our family budget."" Such complaints have been heard many times here and are openly discussed on Saudi television programs, but they have failed so far to bring about change. 'Supporting Islam' ""We wanted to send the message with this drastic action we were forced to undertake that we are not breaking the rules of Islam, but supporting Islam,"" one protester said. ""All those who participated today were veiled and accompanied by other women. They drove slowly and well. They did not break any laws."" The participants said they would repeat their actions again. Several senior Saudi officials interviewed Tuesday night said they supported the women's goals, although they took exception with the protest itself. ""We have been debating this issue for quite some time and some of the most senior people in the country are in favor of allowing women to drive for perfectly handsome reasons,"" said a senior official who asked not to be identified. ""But in our country everything happens through evolution, not revolution."" It was significant that the demonstration took place in Riyadh, which is the heart of the conservative religious establishment. Najd, the region in which Riyadh lies, is largely populated by the descendants of the inner tribal desert Bedouins. Geographically isolated, it has been the region most resistant to the gradual modernization urged by the Saudi Government and the royal family. By contrast, Jidda, a Red Sea port that lies in the region known as Hijaz, has been the most liberal city because of its exposure to travelers and foreigners. Saudi women can be seen there walking without their faces veiled and frequenting public restaurants in the company of their husbands, something that rarely occurs here.","In daring defiance of the  tradition against women driving, about 70 veiled  women gathered on Tuesday in front of a supermarket in , dismissed their drivers and drove in a convoy of cars before being stopped and and detained by the police a short time later.  said the demonstration for the right to drive was the first known open protest by  women and an exceedingly rare manifestation of public sentiment in this conservative Islamic nation.

Mr. , who sat on the sidewalk next with about 25 other, mostly Asian drivers, said he drove his employer, whom he described as a 35-year-old schoolteacher, along with her teen-age daughter. ""There were about 40 cars here and they left us all here,"" he said as other drivers nodded. ""They drove together. I think the police caught them later."" 'We Wanted to Be Heard' The  religious police known as the  rounded up all of the cars and the women at intersections. They prevented curious onlookers from approaching an area where they were stopped on King . The police could be seen asking women to get out from driver's seats and to sit in back seats, as more police cars converged on one site where the women's cars were stopped. The women were deliberately trying to draw attention and fully expected to be arrested, one of the organizers said. ""We wanted to be heard by the authorities, loudly and clearly,"" she said in a telephone interview a few hours later. Later, in separate telephone interviews, two of the women who helped organize the demonstration and who insisted on not being identified explained that they spent a week planning the event. They all agreed that a leading figure behind the protest was  al-Maneh, a sociology professor who received her doctorate from the  in . They described her as an outspoken advocate among hundreds of other educated women in  who have argued that there were no edicts in Islam that ban women from driving. 'Patriotic' Protest Mrs. , who taught for some time at the university here before she reportedly quit in frustration over other restrictions imposed on women, could not be reached for comment. The two women who participated in the organization of the demonstration said they meant no harm to  and strongly defended their action as ""patriotic"" and ""necessary."" ""It is important for the authorities to understand that as educated women who have driven themselves abroad while we pursued graduate studies, we cannot be reduced to being dependent on strangers to drive us,"" said a 36-year-old woman who asked not to be identified by name. ""In addition to being humiliating, this is anti-Islamic,"" she said. ""Islam says that a woman should not be left alone in the company of a man who is not her relative and that is exactly what happens everytime I am driven in my car by a Pakistani, Sudanese or other person who is a driver. Besides, this is very expensive on our family budget."" Such complaints have been heard many times here and are openly discussed on  television programs, but they have failed so far to bring about change. 'Supporting Islam' ""We wanted to send the message with this drastic action we were forced to undertake that we are not breaking the rules of Islam, but supporting Islam,"" one protester said. ""All those who participated today were veiled and accompanied by other women. They drove slowly and well. They did not break any laws."" The participants said they would repeat their actions again. Several senior  officials interviewed Tuesday night said they supported the women's goals, although they took exception with the protest itself. ""We have been debating this issue for quite some time and some of the most senior people in the country are in favor of allowing women to drive for perfectly handsome reasons,"" said a senior official who asked not to be identified. ""But in our country everything happens through evolution, not revolution."" It was significant that the demonstration took place in , which is the heart of the conservative religious establishment. Najd, the region in which  lies, is largely populated by the descendants of the inner tribal desert Bedouins. Geographically isolated, it has been the region most resistant to the gradual modernization urged by the  Government and the royal family. By contrast, Jidda, a Red Sea port that lies in the region known as Hijaz, has been the most liberal city because of its exposure to travelers and foreigners.  women can be seen there walking without their faces veiled and frequenting public restaurants in the company of their husbands, something that rarely occurs here."
"WP",1999,"Norway","Minor Changes Highlight Norway's Title Defense; Defending Champs Blend Veterans, Youth","With all of the attention the U.S. women's national soccer team has been receiving lately, it may be difficult to remember that the defending Women's World Cup champion is Norway. In fact, because China has defeated the United States twice this year, the Norwegians come to Jack Kent Cooke Stadium for a first-round game tonight against Canada in a peculiar darkhorse position. It doesn't seem to matter that Norway is the only team in the 16-team tournament with a winning all-time record against the Americans (11-10-1) or that it finished second in the 1991 Women's World Cup. It also doesn't seem to matter that it thoroughly dominated Russia in their opening first-round game Sunday -- a 2-1 victory in which the Norwegians had a 28-6 advantage in shots and a 12-1 edge in corner kicks. Many observers believe Norway will advance to the semifinals and lose to China without getting a chance to renew its rivalry with the United States. The Norwegians have no problem with that line of thought. It's just that they have other ideas. ""It is all right with us if people look at the United States and China as the favorites,"" assistant coach Jarl Torske said before a light training session Monday at George Mason University. ""We are a much younger team [than in 1995] but the core is made of experienced, world-class players."" Canadian midfielder Amy Walsh said: ""I think they've been overlooked a tad, but you can't overlook Norway. They're such a strong squad."" Four of the Norwegian players who started against Russia had made more than 60 international appearances, led by defender Linda Medalen and midfielder Hege Riise, two of the world's best players, both of whom are playing in their third Women's World Cup. Medalen, who turned 34 six days ago, is a veteran of 146 international matches, but is starting at a new position for the national team. Originally a striker, she has scored a Norwegian-record 63 goals, including eight in Women's World Cup play. Now she anchors the defense while the scoring burden largely has been passed on to 24-year-old Marianne Pettersen, who had a goal and an assist on 11 shots against Russia, and 22-year-old Ragnhild Guldbrandsen. Overseeing this transition has been Coach Per-Mathias Hogmo, who took over the program in 1997. Hogmo played briefly with the men's national squad and had coached several men's youth national teams. But he never had coached a women's team before, and thus had few ties to the women's team's past, which included a bit of slippage after the 1995 Women's World Cup title -- a bronze medal at the 1996 Summer Olympics. Only seven of the 21 members chosen by Hogmo have any World Cup experience. However, it's not as if this group is untested. Unlike the men's World Cup champion, which automatically receives a place in the next tournament, the women's champion receives no such free pass. Thus, the Norwegians were forced to earn their way into the field of 16 the same way everybody except the host team did -- through a qualifying tournament. ""We should be directly qualified like the men,"" Medalen said earlier this month while the team finished its preparations at a training camp in Hyannis, Mass. ""But you have to play the games, and we love to play them."" That's a good thing because Norway's European qualifying group included possibly the continent's second-best team -- Germany. The Norwegians wound up winning their group with a 4-1-1 record, but not before consecutive games in which they lost to Germany, 1-0, and played a scoreless tie with the Netherlands -- a team they had earlier clobbered, 6-1. Although the Norwegians defeated Germany, 3-2, in a rematch, they still needed to defeat England in their final qualifying match to secure first place in the group by one point over the Germans, who later joined them in the Women's World Cup field by routing Ukraine in a two-game playoff. Coming back to finish first in the group ""really helped us build confidence,"" said Riise, who is fourth on Norway's all-time goal list with 43. ""We always felt like we could win the group."" Still, there is no swagger to these players -- no sense that they are the world champions until someone takes the title from them. Their view is that everybody, themselves included, starts from scratch. ""We were the champions in '95,"" Medalen said, ""but that doesn't matter now."" They also say that their rivalry with the United States does not matter -- at least not for now. ""We're not even thinking about"" the Americans, Medalen said. ""And if we do face them, we will prepare for them as though it were just another game."" Meanwhile, Torske, the assistant coach, is helping prepare only for Canada, an opponent he says is quite unlike Russia. ""We knew teams have difficulty scoring against Russia,"" Torske said. ""Canada scores a lot of goals, but they also concede goals. They had some quite close games with the United States, they defeated Australia -- we are not going to underestimate them. Not at all."" Notes: Silvana Burtini, who scored Canada's only goal against Japan Saturday, is questionable for tonight's game because of a strained left hamstring. Coach Neil Turnbull suggested that Isabelle Harvey would start in Burtini's place if she is unable to play. Hickling reported from Hyannis, Mass., Kuhns and Kathy Orton from Washington.","With all of the attention the  women's national soccer team has been receiving lately, it may be difficult to remember that the defending Women's World Cup champion is .

"NYT",1983,"France","NOTES ON FASHION","IS it accidental that at every turn there seems to be something Parisian to delight the eye? Only if you believe in accidents. Still it seems more than coincidence that the Yves Saint Laurent retrospective at the Metropolitan Museum opens next month, that new art exhibitions inspired by one French epoch or another abound and that two New York hotels being built are the Plaza Athenee, on the site of the old Alrae, on 64th Street between Park and Madison Avenues, and the Novotel, at 51st Street and Broadway. Now comes a new book entitled ''The Crazy Years, Paris in the Twenties'' by William Wiser (Atheneum, $27.50), that is perhaps the most expensive gossip column anyone will ever read. It deftly chronicles that era when Paris became the center of a revolution in the arts and fashion. There are bits about James Joyce's taste for conservative clothing and the first time Picasso bought a tuxedo. Most moving is the account of the swiftness with which Coco Chanel transformed women's clothes. Mr. Wiser recounts how Chanel, encouraged by the presence of 80 feminist societies in Paris in 1922, challenged the fashion supremacy of Paul Poiret and his harem-inspired clothes for women. She won, thanks to the androgynous appeal of her linear, black suits. Poiret's lament was, ''Now women all resemble undernourished telephone operators.'' Mr. Wiser's Paris of the 1920's could very well be New York today. WHAT is most annoying about Camouflage, the store at 17th Street and Eighth Avenue, is that it has too many things worth having. Among the best: Alan Flusser's brown leather bomber jacket, based on a design from the 1940's, with a detachable woolen collar covering a leather one, $485; Perry Ellis's new gray tweed walking jacket, cut like a sports jacket but with a large stand- up collar, $375, and Jeffrey Banks's new flannel trousers with double pleats and neatly tapering legs, $135. There is even one spring item, Alexander Julian's sleek black and white glen plaid silk jacket with rounded shoulders and a trim waist, $515. If that fare is too rich, or perhaps too expensive, there are handsome men's cotton handkerchiefs with intricately detailed borders for $3.50. THE FASHION GROUP, under the direction of Sarah Worman, the vice president of J. W. Robinson's in Los Angeles, staged a fashion show last week that was simply a knockout. There was a runway of monolithic proportions and enormous screens for a slide show (or is it called video now?). After featuring the spring fashions of the leading American designers, which almost everyone there had already seen, the group presented the clothes of six young unknowns: Alke Boker, Neil Leonard, Stephen Manniello, Danny Noble, Stephen Sprouse and Tamotsu. The creations of these young designers stood up well next to those of their elders, including: Mr. Leonard's luxurious gray nubby wool skirts worn with ivory-colored charmeuse tanks and long charmeuse coats; Mr. Manniello's oversize roll- collar cotton shirt worn with a high- waisted circle skirt and a red cotton duster; Mr. Noble's series of soft double-breasted gray cotton suits worn with long flowing skirts and berets, and Mr. Sprouse's white leather jackets for spring painted with peace symbols in Day-Glo colors, worn with his graffiti-covered Day-Glo tights. ECCO, the women's shoe store in SoHo, has just opened another store on Columbus Avenue between 75th and 76th Streets. It offers some intriguing new shoe designs. It appears to be emphasizing modern versions of Mary Janes (those pristine shoes with straps across the insteps), but its new styles are anything but dainty. From Robert Clergerie, the French shoe designer who has recently become very popular, there are Mary Janes in black leather with elastic straps that crisscross the instep. From Tokio Kumagai there is a Mary Jane, also in black leather, with a low heel and a strap that cuts a diagonal swath across the foot, is held in place with a tiny bit of elastic and flares out over the heel like a little wing. The store is getting crowded. MICHAEL IVES is a graduate of Yale, plays the piano and is one of the most successful male models today. Like other models, he has decided to produce his own sportswear, complete with a little insignia on the shirts. The knit polo shirts with cotton twill collars are undistinguished, however, as are the jogging pants, made of polyurethane, and the boat- neck sweaters, in limp cotton knit. Mr. Ives did not design the clothes but he had, he said, final approval. It should be a lesson to those who are not designers and are considering the possibility: Think twice before signing on the dotted line. THE new Italian Vogue for children may just call for a PG rating. It is filled with Bruce Weber's pictures of children dressed in motorcycle jackets, caps and leather boots standing with older models dressed as members of a motorcyle gang. It has an edgy, funny, 1960's appeal, but whoever thought children could look so mean?","IS it accidental that at every turn there seems to be something ian to delight the eye?

"NYT",1986,"France","NOTES ON FASHION","THE best fun at the semiannual European ready-to-wear fashion collections isn't always on the runway. Sometimes it's in the audience. At Chanel in Paris, for example, a front row seat was reserved for Carole Bouquet, the actress, who has just become the new face of the No. 5 fragrance. ''Why?'' she said. ''I have no idea. But they believe in me. They must be right.'' And Kathleen Turner, the actress, turned up with her husband, Jay Weiss, a real-estate operator, at Nino Cerruti's Paris show of his softened-up but still sophisticated line. ''I like her face,'' Mr. Weiss said, pointing out one model to his wife. Then he quickly added, ''But I like your face better.'' To which Miss Turner responded, ''You're such a good sport.'' MANY of the best collections in Europe are found off the beaten track. Nikos showed his men's intimate apparel collection behind his new store at 36 rue de Sevigne. His styles look like a male-underwear version of Azzedine Alaia's designs for women. They included briefs with V-shaped cutouts, seductive striped silk pajamas, bodysuits with starburstlike seams and an athletic gray union suit. And at an exhibition at the Ecole des Beaux Arts, on the Left Bank, several of 20 young designers hit fashion home runs. Standouts included Stephane Plassier's reversible cat-burglar black blouson jackets with diamond-print linings hidden inside, and his Chairman Mao-on-safari styles; Claudie Perlot's mix-and-match designs for the young working woman; Premonville et Dewavrin's bicolor blazers that looked a bit like racing silks, and Yorke & Cole's long poplin shirt with pockets that pull out and tie back into a bustle. VIVIENNE WESTWOOD is often credited with creating the punk and post-punk styles that emerged from Britain in the 70's. Less often is she cited for what she called the ''minicrinnie'' crinolined skirts she introduced in Paris last year. They were a primary influence behind the new girlish looks, which have swept severity and man-tailoring for women off Europe's fashion map. At World's End, her recently reopened, slanty-floored shop on King's Road, Ms. Westwood is back offering her own individual tilt on style. The big clock over the shop's door runs backward, but Miss Westwood's designs remain far forward of fashion. ''I'm using the shop as a crucible'' for the fall collection to show next spring, she explained. ''It's a very nice way to do market research and it keeps the vanguard going,'' Ms. Westwood added. She has already produced a small number of dresses and skirts like those she hopes to sell worldwide next year. Among the most advanced are lamp-shade-shaped skirt silhouettes, which are boned on the outside. Although selling styles before they've even been shown on the runway is risky business, Ms. Westwood is unafraid of being knocked off again. ''I don't think anyone's going to do it as well, even if they steal it,'' she said. YVES SAINT LAURENT certainly should know about knockoffs. That was clear at a private viewing of a retrospective exhibit of his much-copied designs at the fashion museum in the Louvre. The viewing followed the showing of his collection, and something else was clear as well. The startling beauty of the designs on display highlighted the lack of innovation in his overly safe spring line. FOR many, the best fashion show of the journey just past was not at any of the fashion shows, but at Fishmongers' Hall, overlooking London Bridge, where, on the night that city's designer shows began, the British Fashion Council held a banquet. The purpose was to celebrate British fashion. But the point, as far as most of the guests were concerned, was to get a glimpse of one guest, Diana, Princess of Wales, who arrived with her hair and bare shoulders sprayed with glitter. The first question most asked was, whose dress was she wearing? The long purple panne velvet gown was ''not ours,'' said Maria Cornejo, co-designer of the street-style Richmond-Cornejo collection. A few moments later, the answer came from Bruce Oldfield, who filtered through the throng to say that it was his. Mr. Oldfield must have been feeling his oats, because after dinner, but before the obligatory toast to the Queen, he alone lit a cigarette, drawing envious stares from those smokers better versed in protocol. After presenting the British Designer of the Year Award to Jasper Conran, the Princess went into a side room to meet more guests. There she joked that she'd given the prize to Mr. Conran because ''he looked like he was falling asleep.'' THAT wasn't the only good line at the London collections. At a breakfast presentation of the Joseph line, Marie Helvin, who used to be a model married to David Bailey and is now an author (of ''Catwalk,'' a modeling memoir) and journalist (covering fashion for a London newspaper), mused on the differences between a writer's life and a model's.

"NYT",2014,"Afghanistan","Peace Effort With Taliban Is Excluding Women, Report Says","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghan women have been systematically excluded from the government's efforts to start peace talks with the Taliban, according to a report released on Monday by the international aid group Oxfam. The report, ''Behind Closed Doors,'' echoes complaints made by many female leaders here. Among the issues they cite are that they have long felt marginalized in the country's nascent peace process, and that they are worried that Afghanistan's leaders will reach an agreement to reconcile with religiously conservative insurgents that will wipe out gains made by the nation's women. ''We've always been concerned about the threat that our leaders will trade women's rights away for peace,'' said Sara Surkhabi, a senator and one of nine women on the Afghan High Peace Council, which has 61 men. ''We need to fight for our rights or we'll lose all the advances we've won.'' There are more former Taliban members on the High Peace Council -- at least 11, Ms. Surkhabi pointed out -- than there are women. ''Some of the old Taliban even oppose the participation of women in such meetings,'' she said. Oxfam's report details 11 instances of direct or indirect peace talks between the international community and the Taliban or other insurgents since 2005, none of which had any confirmed participation by women. It also lists 16 such efforts carried out by the Afghan government, only three of which involved any female delegates, and those were fewer than 10 percent of the government representatives involved. During the Taliban government, from the autumn of 1996 until late 2001, nearly all the rights of women were revoked: They were forbidden to work, attend school or leave their homes unaccompanied by a husband or close male relative. Since then, countries have repeatedly insisted that Taliban acceptance of the Afghan Constitution's guarantee of women's rights is a ''red line,'' a prerequisite for their participation in peace talks. ''The international community used women's rights to help justify its presence in Afghanistan,'' said John Watt, Oxfam's director for Afghanistan. The group has long had a large presence in the country, including during the Taliban's rule. ''Having brought about some improvements and investing more than $100 billion in aid, it would be a tragedy if progress was reversed,'' Mr. Watt said. ''As donors rush to the exit, Afghans should not have to worry that the world will forget promises made to Afghan women and allow women's rights to be negotiated away.'' But that is what many women worry has been happening during efforts to start peace talks. ''Afghan Women's Network has made repeated requests to be at the negotiating table because we do not want our rights to be sacrificed,'' the report quoted Lida Nadery, a member of the network, the largest coalition of women's groups in the country, as saying. ''We are not included in any talks. We always find out after the meetings that there was contact but no one tells us what was discussed.'' On the three occasions where some women were included in preliminary peace talks, they were few in number and faced opposition to their presence. In a round of talks in the Maldives, for instance, a BBC reporter said that the representatives of the insurgents complained that the women were present without husbands or close male relatives accompanying them. The Oxfam report expresses concern that countries might compromise on some prerequisites for talks with the Taliban, including on women's issues. The report says the group interviewed an official at the American Embassy in Kabul in 2011 who played down the prerequisite regarding women. ''We do recognize the need for protection of women's rights,'' the official said, according to the report. ''But we can't impose this as a prenegotiation red line because that will be counterproductive in getting to talks. Women's issues are important, but they are not our top priority.'' An embassy spokeswoman, Monica Cummings, said on Monday, ''That is not an accurate representation of U.S. policy.'' ''We have made it very clear that any process with the Taliban or other insurgent groups must first include protection of women and minorities,'' she continued. ''Women's rights have always been a top U.S. priority, and our policy on that has not changed.'' The report also expresses hope that the new government of President Ashraf Ghani will be more inclusive in its approach to peace negotiations. Mr. Ghani has pledged to bring more women into government, but he has so far made no concrete steps in that direction as negotiations on forming a new cabinet drag on. ''As the possibility of a new round of peace talks gains momentum under a new Afghan government,'' Mr. Watt said, ''Oxfam is concerned that a sustainable peace agreement will not be possible if women are denied a stake in negotiations.'' Oxfam's report calls on the government to guarantee that at least 30 percent of all future peace delegates be women, including members of the High Peace Council. It also asks that Afghan women's views be included in a current high-level review of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1325, which urges that women be represented in all peace talks worldwide. Ms. Surkhabi said there was a practical reason for such inclusion. ''Women want peace more than men do,'' she said.",",  --  women have been systematically excluded from the government's efforts to start peace talks with the , according to a report released on Monday by the international aid group .

"NYT",2012,"Canada","Report Urges 'Cultural Shift' as Coaches Defy Concussion Specialists","Despite several years of intensive research, coverage and discussion about the dangers of concussions, the idea of playing through head injuries is so deeply rooted in hockey culture that two university teams kept concussed players on the ice even though they were taking part in a major concussion study. The study, which will be published Friday in a series of articles in the journal Neurosurgical Focus, was conducted during the 2011-12 hockey season by researchers from the University of Western Ontario, the University of Montreal, Harvard and other institutions. ''This culture is entrenched at all levels of hockey, from peewee to university,'' said Dr. Paul S. Echlin, a concussion specialist and researcher in Burlington, Ontario, and the lead author of the study. ''Concussion is a significant public health issue that requires a generational shift. As with smoking or seat belts, it doesn't just happen overnight -- it takes a massive effort and collective movement.'' The study is believed to be among the most comprehensive analyses of concussions in hockey, which has a rate of head trauma approaching that of football. Researchers followed two Canadian university teams -- a men's team and a women's team -- and scanned every player's brain before and after the season. Players who sustained head injuries also received scans at three intervals after the injuries, with researchers using advanced magnetic resonance imaging techniques. The teams were not named in the study, in which an independent specialist physician was present at each game and was empowered to pull any player off the ice for examination if a potential concussion was observed. The men's team, with 25 players and an average age of 22, played a 28-game regular season and a 3-game postseason. The women's team, with 20 players and an average age of 20, played 24 regular-season games and no playoff games. Over the course of the season, there were five observed or self-reported concussions on the men's team and six on the women's team. Researchers noted several instances of coaches, trainers and players avoiding examinations, ignoring medical advice or otherwise obstructing the study, even though the players had signed consent forms to participate and university ethics officials had given institutional consent. ''Unless something is broken, I want them out playing,'' one coach said, according to the study. In one incident, a neurologist observing the men's team pulled a defenseman during the first period of a game after the player took two hits and was skating slowly. During the intermission the player reported dizziness and was advised to sit out, but the coach suggested he play the second period and ''skate it off.'' The defenseman stumbled through the rest of the game. ''At the end of the third period, I spoke with the player and the trainer and said that he should not play until he was formally evaluated and underwent the formal return-to-play protocol,'' the neurologist said, as reported in the study. ''I was dismayed to see that he played the next evening.'' After the team returned from its trip, the neurologist questioned the trainer about overruling his advice and placing the defenseman at risk. ''The trainer responded that he and the player did not understand the decision and that most of the team did not trust the neurologist,'' according to the study. ''He requested that the physician no longer be used to cover any more games.'' In another episode, a physician observer assessed a minor concussion in a female player and recommended that she miss the next night's game. Even though the coach's own playing career had ended because of concussions, she overrode the medical advice and inserted the player the next evening. According to the report, the coach refused to speak to another physician observer on the second evening. The trainer was reluctant to press the issue with the coach because, the trainer said, the coach did not want the study to interfere with the team. ''Interesting gap between theory and practice,'' one of the study's physicians said in the report. ''The athlete's and coach's decision to return to play the next day despite incurring a minor concussion reflects what occurs thousands of times every day.'' After this second instance of a coach overriding medical advice following a concussion diagnosis, the researchers talked to the coaches about the serious long-term threat their actions posed to their players' health. By the end of the study, the teams' cooperation improved markedly. A similar study by Echlin's research team followed two Canadian junior hockey teams, with male players ages 16 to 20, for the 2009-10 season. In that study, independent specialists examined players immediately after on-ice collisions and were able to recommend they be held out of games. Coaches and trainers resisted that study as well, and one of the two junior teams dropped out during the season. That study found concussion rates seven times higher than previously reported. In the study to be published Friday, the male players sustained concussions at three times the rate reported in most previous studies, and the female players at five times the rate reported in most studies. The women also sustained concussions almost twice as frequently as the men, despite rules in women's hockey designed to curb body checking. The brain scans taken after the season also showed substantive metabolic changes among the majority of players, including those who were not diagnosed with concussions. Researchers said the changes in the brains might be evidence of trauma caused by subconcussive blows. ''You may not need to have a diagnosed concussion to actually have changes in your white matter,'' said Dr. Inga K. Koerte, a researcher in the study. ''It may be that subconcussive blows to your head accumulate over time, so that you develop changes that are similar to when you have one clinical concussion.'' Koerte, of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, Harvard and the University of Munich, stressed that the finding in this area was preliminary and required further research. Echlin said that dismissive attitudes toward head trauma persisted in hockey at all levels, despite the widespread attention on Sidney Crosby's drawn-out recovery from concussion symptoms in 2011 and 2012. ''This is our national game which we all love,'' Echlin wrote, ''and it is time to consider a cultural shift to address the prevention and treatment of this serious brain injury that is occurring at epidemic proportions.''","Despite several years of intensive research, coverage and discussion about the dangers of concussions, the idea of playing through head injuries is so deeply rooted in hockey culture that two university teams kept concussed players on the ice even though they were taking part in a major concussion study.

Coaches and trainers resisted that study as well, and one of the two junior teams dropped out during the season. That study found concussion rates seven times higher than previously reported. In the study to be published Friday, the male players sustained concussions at three times the rate reported in most previous studies, and the female players at five times the rate reported in most studies. The women also sustained concussions almost twice as frequently as the men, despite rules in women's hockey designed to curb body checking. The brain scans taken after the season also showed substantive metabolic changes among the majority of players, including those who were not diagnosed with concussions. Researchers said the changes in the brains might be evidence of trauma caused by subconcussive blows. ''You may not need to have a diagnosed concussion to actually have changes in your white matter,'' said Dr. , a researcher in the study. ''It may be that subconcussive blows to your head accumulate over time, so that you develop changes that are similar to when you have one clinical concussion.'' , of  in ,  and the , stressed that the finding in this area was preliminary and required further research.  said that dismissive attitudes toward head trauma persisted in hockey at all levels, despite the widespread attention on 's drawn-out recovery from concussion symptoms in 2011 and 2012. ''This is our national game which we all love,''  wrote, ''and it is time to consider a cultural shift to address the prevention and treatment of this serious brain injury that is occurring at epidemic proportions.''"
"WP",2009,"Iran","Role of Women In Iran Protest Kindles Hope; Female Muslims Abroad Say They Draw Inspiration For Own Struggle at Home","Over the past two weeks, Marcelle George has watched with amazement as legions of Iranian women, most wearing black, full-length Islamic garments, defiantly protested Iran's leadership. Even in her native Egypt, where some opposition to the government is permitted, most women would never dare cross that line. ""To actually see Iranian women fight for their rights is inspiring,"" said George, a college student in jeans and a long-sleeve blouse. ""I never imagined that it could happen there."" As Iran's theocracy appears on the verge of silencing the biggest challenge to its authority since it was established in 1979, female activists in the region say they are inspired by the prominent role women are playing in the country's opposition movement. Many hope it will have a crossover effect on the struggle for women's rights in their own countries and help shatter Western perceptions of Middle Eastern women as subjugated in a male-dominated culture. In a region that reveres men who die in battle, some of the major icons to emerge from the Iranian demonstrations have been women. Neda Agha Soltan, the music student whose bloody death on June 20 was videotaped and broadcast around the world, became an instant symbol of the opposition movement and sparked widespread outrage. Opposition leader Mir Hossein Mousavi 's wife, Zahra Rahnavard, has also taken on a prominent role as she accompanied her husband on the campaign trail and more recently spoke out against an election result that the opposition says was fraudulent. ""This is our time, women's time,"" said Khoulod Al Fahed, a Saudi businesswoman and blogger. ""It is the time for women to speak up and demand the rights that have been stolen from us in the name of religion and culture."" Middle Eastern women have long played active roles in the struggle for democracy and human rights. In recent months, women have won small yet unprecedented victories. In Kuwait, four female lawmakers were elected to parliament last month, the first time women have won seats in the nation's legislature. In Egypt, election law was recently changed to give women a quota of 64 parliamentary seats. Palestinian women have launched protests to free prisoners held by Israel, while Egyptian women have organized labor and pro-democracy strikes in recent years. But few events in recent memory have drawn as much attention as the sight of thousands of Iranian women taking to the streets, defiantly challenging their leaders and the election results. Grainy cellphone video and photos of the female protesters have flooded the Internet and the blogosphere, especially the haunting images of Agha Soltan as she died. ""Everyone is so shocked to see that beautiful young girl dying and looking so modern and secular,"" said Azar Nafisi, author of ""Reading Lolita in Tehran"" and a professor at Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies. ""What's happening in Iran is much more on a larger scale, with huge repercussions and risks,"" said Baho Abdula, 31, an Egyptian activist. ""It does break the stereotype of the Middle East women. And it shows the contradictions inside Iran. ""People trusted themselves, believed in something. And that feeling will live on long, especially with women. It was a huge empowerment to lead the protests,"" she added. ""They didn't fear the state. Images like that live on."" In Iran, such a prominent role is less surprising. Although women face discrimination in legal realms such as inheritance, custody and court testimony, they have a more visible, and more vocal, role in society and politics than in many countries in the region. In fact, some women found themselves with more opportunities after the 1979 Islamic revolution, as more traditional families began educating their daughters when the schools became segregated and Islamicized. The result has been the best-educated generation of women in Iranian history. More than 60 percent of university students are women, and female lawyers, doctors, athletes and politicians are not uncommon. There are female taxi drivers and even women in the Basij, a pro-government militia. A woman, Shirin Ebadi, won Iran's first Nobel Peace Prize in 2003. Many Iranians remember the participation of women in the revolution -- and afterward, when the ruling clerics sought to limit their rights. ""When Imam Khomeini first imposed edicts for veiling, women came in with such force that he had to take it back"" and introduce it more slowly, Nafisi said. At the time, the middle and working classes joined forces to oppose limitations on their rights, she said. ""It created a unity between different strata of women because they realized these laws applied to all of them."" This time, many prominent women joined the opposition movement because of Rahnavard, who campaigned alongside her husband. Rahnavard, a former chancellor of Tehran's Alzahra University for women, held hands with Mousavi as the couple entered auditoriums. ""The world there looked at women here as if they are all under the Taliban rule. For the first time, they are seeing that the Muslim woman is also a leader and a partner,"" said Sawsan Zakzak, head of the League of Syrian Women, in Damascus. In Iraq, which fought an eight-year war with neighboring Iran, many women say they have long admired the strong roles Iranian women played during the revolution. Once among the Arab world's most liberated, Iraqi women today are frequently targets of extremists or harsh tribal codes, with few rights or freedoms. ""We want Iraqi women to imitate Iranian women in boldly and courageously expressing their views, especially since Iraqi women do not lack courage or daring,"" said Samira Musawi, a lawyer and member of parliament with Iraq's ruling Shiite alliance. Aliya Nusayef, another Iraqi member of parliament, said many female lawmakers were voting on issues, including women's rights, based on ""what their political parties are telling them, not what they believe in."" ""Let us hope that Iranian women would spur our women to become involved and active in securing their rights,"" she said. But in ultraconservative parts of the Arab world, the Iranian uprising has underscored the immense obstacles women face in the region. In Saudi Arabia, women cannot vote. Nor are they allowed to drive. Although the government has enacted some changes, such as appointing the kingdom's first female deputy minister, clerics control the courts and apply an austere version of Sunni Islamic law. Fahed, the Saudi blogger, said many similarities exist between Iran and Saudi Arabia in their treatment of women. ""But women's battle in Iran is with the government. In Saudi Arabia, it is with the religious authority,"" Fahed said. ""I really believe that the Saudi government is in favor of change. But the religious authorities here are so powerful. Religious men are resisting any change in favor of women's rights."" Diana Moukalled, a Lebanese columnist who has produced a series of documentaries about Iran, said Iran's Shiite doctrine is less strict about the concept of female participation in society than the Sunni doctrine of most of the Arab world. Others say a mostly Sunni Arab society would not be influenced by Shiite Persian culture. ""What's going on will sure set an example, but I don't expect it to be reflected in any similar action,"" Moukalled said. ""It is much more difficult to stir change here."" Abdula, the Egyptian activist, said younger women will probably be the most influenced by the situation in Iran. Many have followed the events through blogs and social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter. In interviews outside the gates of Cairo University and in cafes last week, a dozen young Egyptian women expressed solidarity with Iran's female protesters. They had all heard about Agha Soltan's death and expressed outrage and sympathy. Yet most doubted whether they as women could bring any meaningful reform to an authoritarian government such as Egypt's. Some said they were willing to try. ""It encourages me, but I don't know how to translate that into action,"" George said. ""We have to find ourselves a role to play here."" Staff writer Tara Bahrampour in Washington, correspondents Thomas Erdbrink in Tehran and Howard Schneider in Jerusalem and special correspondents Alia Ibrahim in Beirut, K.I. Ibrahim in Baghdad, Samuel Sokol in Jerusalem and Sherine al-Bayoumi in Cairo contributed to this report.","Over the past two weeks,  has watched with amazement as legions of ian women, most wearing black, full-length Islamic garments, defiantly protested 's leadership.

"NYT",1994,"France","RUNWAYS; Breaking Taboos By Finding Joy In Frills and Fun","LINDA EVANGELISTA in feather bodice, with spun-sugar tulle skirt and matching Marilyn Monroe hair, was whisking her lemon mousse of a dress in front of Steven Meisel. In an adjacent tableau at John Galliano's show, Kate Moss was competing with a 1950's Oldsmobile to see who had the most streamlined curves. And Nadja Auermann, moonbeam-blond head touching the floor, was holding a dying-swan pose. In a rare moment at the Paris shows, seasoned professionals savored the fun, jollity and frivolity of fashion. It was a revelation -- even a revolution for a generation brought up in the feminist era -- to see clothes that had no practical application to modern life but that just seemed appealing for their own sake. The European season had other moments of joie de vivre: the giddy carousel of fashion history spun by Jean-Paul Gaultier to hurdy-gurdy music. The Moll Flanders frolics at Vivienne Westwood. Even at Comme des Garcons, ripples of frills broke out from the usually dour designs of Rei Kawakubo, as though rejoicing in new-found femininity. The sense of jubilation was more than just an enthusiastic response to a strong Paris season. It marked a change of attitude from the view that has prevailed since feminism first frowned on fashion a quarter of a century ago and dismissed it as the goal of ""a silly woman always running for her mirror to see who she is."" Those were the words of Marilyn French in her 1977 novel, ""The Women's Room,"" which placed its heroine, Mira, at Harvard in 1968 as a mature student relearning life from a feminist perspective. Since the 1960's, fashion has been viewed as a sign of feminine weakness or masculine exploitation, hence the metaphorical burning of the bra and the ritual adoption of the pants suits of the male oppressors. The idea of female desire for pretty things has been treated as an aberration of upbringing; the pleasure that clothes can bring has been reduced to a brisk acceptance of a well-cut jacket. Sensual pleasure over the soft pile of a cashmere sweater, the tang of fine leather shoes or the rich color of a velvet scarf has been stifled with a sense of guilt. But the time seems to have come for a reappraisal of things that women were conventionally supposed to enjoy, and which some always have. Fashion for its own sake is back on the agenda, since the clothes that made news in Paris were the antithesis of the sensible, practical, no-fuss American sportswear that has colonized closets throughout the Western World. Sure, Gaultier showed jeans -- but only to skirt the iconography of femininity, making denim into frilled Edwardian pantaloons, a picture hat or buttoned boots. His show accentuated the feminine in a witty way, with purses dangling from wrists and the models walking with dainty, ladylike steps. Ultrafeminine stereotyping with a twist of kitsch is Christian Lacroix's stock in trade. His verve and ooh-la-la exuberance came from using night-for-day fabrics -- shiny satin and metallic weaves -- and by using the curvy cuts and flirty shapes that seem like quintessential French frivolity. The Latin idea of dressing to please your man is despised or eschewed in Northern European countries and in North America. Anglo-Saxon guilt about self-indulgence and the Puritan ethic combine to make pampering and preening that French or Italian women take for granted seem ignoble. Those designers like Emanuel Ungaro, Oscar de la Renta or Valentino (all of Latin origin) who blatantly have seduction as their fashion goal seem at odds with modern fashion. But Vivienne Westwood, steeped in British irony, expresses the revisionist view of feminine allure -- all uplifting corsets and padded bustles. Even Karl Lagerfeld at Chanel gave an ironic flip to erogenous dressing by putting sequinned G-strings under split skirts. Why did the idea become entrenched that a woman with a good mind should feel bad about indulging in fashion? That concept goes back a long way, at least to George Eliot's 1870's novel ""Middlemarch,"" when Dorothea Brooke's blue-stocking status is confirmed in the opening chapter. Her flighty sister, Celia, decorates herself in Mama's jewels, while Dorothea tries to justify her delight in their color and sparkle by interpreting them as religious emblems. Fine clothes associated only with air-heads is a theme even in George Orwell's ""Animal Farm,"" when the pretty white mare, Mollie, set up as a symbol of feminine weakness, hopes that the revolution will mean that she can eat sugar and wear ribbons in her mane. Although vintage Hollywood glamour may be the current inspiration for fashion, the silver-screen stereotype of the femme fatale with blond hair, pneumatic bosom and clinging dress has long since been abandoned in films. Predictably, it was Julia Roberts as the hooker in ""Pretty Woman"" who got to enjoy shopping for new clothes, while Melanie Griffith in ""Working Girl"" appeared prim and abstemious -- at least until she took over from her female boss. The fear of being perceived as a frivolous fashion plate is the bete noire of the career woman, who will worry at the lack of sober styles in the European collections, where even Giorgio Armani outed the bra. Even women who are still supposed to be ambassadors for their menfolk shy from fashion. Political wives remember the opprobrium heaped on Nancy Reagan by the writer Joan Didion, who dismissed her as Pretty Nancy in her first year as Governor's wife, and from the scandal of free designer clothes as First Lady. So fashion in general has been considered unworthy of women who have progressed beyond the stage of being decorative trophies for men. Yet, Galliano's show stirred in even the most sensible soul the desire to dress up. His celebration of style involved not just graceful couture clothes, frankly feminine makeup and artful hairdos, but even room sets with the feminine dressing table -- all silver-backed hair brushes, makeup jars and ivory-handled mirrors. Many women will dismiss designer fashion as irrelevant to their lives, or hope that this week's New York fashion shows will offer common-sense solutions. Yet, there is no denying that all designers at the cutting edge are reinterpreting once-despised femininity, from the mean-streets style of Alexander McQueen or Helmut Lang in Europe, to the ""babe power"" fluffiness young American designers are thrusting in the face of functional sportswear. Will the rediscovery of the feminine self strike a chord with the consumer? Beneath the mannish power suits of independent women, more hearts may have beaten for fashion than anyone has dared to admit. In ""The Women's Room,"" Mira's friend Val makes an entrance at a costume party in a ""sexy black pant-suit trimmed with feathers,"" silver spray in her hair and a dash of blue-glitter eye shadow. Ms. French writes: ""She stood there unperturbed by her bulk, her age, posing like a vamp of the 30's, laughing, triumphant, at herself and her illusions and desires, at the foolishness of glamour and its joy, and the colorlessness of a world without it. Some of us understood."" Unabashed guilt-free pleasure from fashion?

"WP",1999,"Canada","Russians Chart a New Path","Russia made sure its first Women's World Cup was a success today. Canada simply made plans to go home. With a 4-1 victory at Giants Stadium, surprising Russia qualified for the quarterfinals, finishing second in Group C. Russia will play China as part of a Wednesday doubleheader in San Jose. Canada, meanwhile, finished its second World Cup with the same victory total -- zero. Canada is 0-4-2 in its two Cup appearances, having been outscored 25-8. Players have complained that their six weeks of pre-Cup training was not enough, and today some said they had been told the national team program would disband until 2003 Cup qualification unless it made the eight-team field for next year's Olympics (it didn't). ""I hope the program doesn't take 10 steps back,"" Canada midfielder Charmaine Hooper said. ""We can't take two or three years off and still compete at this level. I think since the last World Cup, the U.S. has played 100 games. We've only played 10."" A crowd of 29,401 witnessed the game, the first half of a doubleheader with China-Australia following. It was the Women's World Cup's best attendance for a game not involving the United States. A victory today would have put Canada (0-2-1) in the quarterfinals instead of Russia (2-1). In a scoreless first half, Canada looked more than capable of winning, too. The Canadians dominated the midfield and created the majority of the half's scoring chances; Russia's starters were sluggish and the reserves weren't even on the bench. Presumably they were in a cool locker room instead of on the field, where it was 88 degrees and humid at kickoff. ""Indeed, our number one opponent was the heat,"" said Coach Yurii Bystritskii, whose players compete in a domestic league that features indoor play. Russia seemed to be a different team after halftime, however. Natalia Barbachina was stuffed at point-blank range by Canada goalkeeper Nicci Wright in the 47th minute; Irina Grigorieva had a free kick chance just outside of the box in the 49th minute; and Galina Komarova got free but shot high in the 50th. Grigorieva finally cashed in on a Russian chance in the 54th minute. The captain and playmaking midfielder cut through the middle and fired a shot from about 22 yards. It tucked under the crossbar and Russia took a 1-0 lead. ""We had our chances as well as they had their chances,"" said Canada forward Silvana Burtini, who usually starts but came on in the 55th minute after missing Wednesday's loss to Norway with a left hamstring injury. ""They took their opportunities and put them in the back of the net."" Substitute Elena Fomina scored the first of her two goals in the 66th minute to make it 2-0, again on a shot from outside the box. Hooper cut Russia's lead in half with a header in the 76th minute, but Fomina put away the game 10 minutes later, blasting in a cross from Olga Letuchova. Olga Karasseva put the final touches on the victory, scoring a goal off a corner kick in extra time.  CHINA 3, AUSTRALIA 1: First, Sun Wen hit the goal post and missed in the 33rd minute. Six minutes later, the Chinese star forward hit the post and scored. Six minutes after halftime, she struck again -- no goal post required -- and China was on its way to clinching first place in Group D and eliminating Australia. Before the match started, China had secured a spot in the quarterfinals, and Australia knew it needed to win and get unlikely help from Ghana to advance. In the second minute, things became more difficult for the Matildas when forward Alicia Ferguson was sent off for a tackle from behind. ""Even though we had 10 [players], we had the same number of defenders and the same number of midfielders,"" Australia Coach Greg Brown said. ""We should have defended better than we did.""

"NYT",1989,"France","Saint Laurant Deals His Strong Suit: Easy Separates","Yves Saint Laurent says that his message for spring is ''easy dressing'' and that it is best expressed in his suits. The audience at his couture opening resolutely cheered the soft chiffon dresses with the deep, sexy slits. By the end of the show, the crowd was standing and applauding. Occupying front-row seats, in addition to reporters and retailers, were Danielle Mitterrand, the wife of the French President; Monique Lang, the wife of the Minister of Culture; Americans who care about clothes, like Nan Kempner and Deeda Blair; and other designers, including Sonia Rykiel, Thierry Mugler and Patrick Kelly. The designer manages to pull together elements popping up at other couture houses with professionalism and charm, while adding his own signatures. He never descends into vulgarity to capture a few headlines and cause a few tongues to wag. Like Chanel, whom he admires, he has added some classics to the language of fashion, including loose overblouses derived from Breton fishermen; ''le smoking,'' or men's dinner clothes for women; and suits as crisply tailored as men's styles but adapted for women. He is also responsible for less obvious design ideas, like the combination of black with navy in the same outfit. This time he shows high splayed-heel pumps in medium brown instead of the expected black, or navy with brilliant or subdued colors. It has the authority of a new classic. Saint Laurent cannot be matched as a colorist, and this shows up in suits as well as flower-strewn chiffon evening dresses. The simple addition of a hot-pink blouse adds panache to the black pants suit that opens the collection. The wide-leg trousers and hipbone-length jacket illustrate the designer's easy dressing doctrine. The square padded shoulders add an assertiveness to the basic suit shape. There are plenty of diversions, including collarless blouses with deep V-necklines and big cuff links the size of silver dollars. Suit sleeves decorated with gold buttons are cut short enough to show the cuffs. This is a main source of glitter. In addition to the short, wide trousers, which end just above the ankles or below the calf, there are plenty of knee-baring skirts, cut with rounded panels that open to show a flash of leg when the model walks. For later in the day, the designer tosses crisp wool or heavy silk blazers over soft, short chiffon dresses. It was the most innovative touch in the collection, said Marie-Helene de Rothschild, a fervid couture fan, after the show. It was the first style she would try on, she added. A surprise entry for day wear is the tailored dress for the woman who does not want to wear suits all the time. Many women who like dresses complain the styles they see are too dowdy. Not at Saint Laurent. His red, green or navy silk shantung dresses punctuated with gold buttons from neck to hem have considerable style. So do some softer styles that tie at one side and manage to show some leg as well. These supplement the fisherman top, which rests on the hips over a matching linen skirt, serving as a casual two-piece dress. But this is the couture collection, not necessarily aimed at the working woman, so practical dressing is not the only goal. Evening is the time for fantasy. Saint Laurent starts his evening collection soberly enough with new versions of ''le smoking.'' Not that they are boring. Even in black with a white shirt, they have an austere, stylish look. In addition to standard one-button to-the-hip jackets, there are waist-length jackets with both skirts and pants. The liveliest are in white with black or navy pants. Crepe jackets and satin pants in brilliant red or green lead into the bougainvillea-print dresses, which are Saint Laurent's own festival of flowers. Jackets in multicolor cotton brocades are accompanied with green dahlia-printed blouses and pink silk pants, for example. A long green strapless chiffon dress is lightly covered with a flower-printed sheer organza coat. Among the more spectacular styles is an orange silk cape covered with cutout and appliqued purple silk bougainvillea flowers. Short jackets were elaborately decorated with thick baroque braid and bead-embroidered jackets that suggested the splendor of the robes of Far Eastern potentates. Then came the conclusion of the show, a model in a bridal dress, escorted down the runway by the designer. She wore in a white silk shantung jacket and skirt. Easy dressing, as the designer said. Italian couture designers have not tried to storm Paris since Simonetta and Fabiani, a husband-and-wife team who designed separate collections, and Roberto Capucci showed their clothes here in the 1950's, all without great success. This season, two other designers are making the attempt. Gianni Versace showed his atelier collection today in rooms at the Hotel Meurice. To introduce what he called a concept rather than a collection, he took over the Musee D'Orsay for a dinner for 250 people. His new clothes will not be shown on models but on friends from Italy and Paris who have already ordered them. The atelier concept, which he sees as an experimental workshop involving fashions for the theater and video screen, will be explained in a film about his work with Maurice Bejart. The Versace clothes all involve some pleating. They go one step further than the French ready-to-wear clothes which are available to anyone who can pay for them. His styles will be strictly one of a kind, he said. If a second woman should want to order the dress, he said, he would be obliged to make some changes. Prices for this exclusivity will start at about $4,000 for the simplest styles. Embroidery is, of course, extra.  Valentino, Rome's leading couture designer, will show his collection for the first time Thursday evening at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts. He has introduced his ready-to-wear here for 15 years. He decided to show his couture collection because airline strikes were making Rome inaccessible for customers and the press, he said.","Yves Saint  says that his message for spring is ''easy dressing'' and that it is best expressed in his suits.

"NYT",2000,"Canada","Sandra Schmirler, 36, Dies; Olympic Curling Champion","Sandra Schmirler, the star of the first women's curling team to win an Olympic gold medal and one of Canada's most popular athletes, died Thursday in Regina, Saskatchewan. She was 36. She died of cancer, the Canadian Curling Association said. Known as Schmirler the Curler, Schmirler starred in a sport that is one of Canada's passions, especially with families in the western provinces. One newspaper called her the public face of a Canadian sport. ""When you played her, you were in awe,"" Colleen Jones, a two-time Canadian champion, told The Globe and Mail of Toronto. ""You knew she was better. You knew she was going to beat you. It was like playing against Gretzky."" All curlers, men and women, recognized her focus and skill. ""She is one of the best players, probably the best player ever,"" said Russ Howard of New Brunswick. ""She raised the level of curling. It's unbelievable what she did.""  Curlers slide round granite stones down a 146-foot-long, 15-foot-7 1/2-inch-wide sheet of ice into a 12-foot circle known as the house, while two sweepers with straw or synthetic brooms help steer the stone. Schmirler, who was born in Biggar, Saskatchewan, on June 11, 1963, was introduced to curling when she was 12. By high school, she had won provincial prep titles in curling while also starring in badminton and volleyball. After graduating from the University of Regina, Schmirler was asked to join a local team. Later, she joined forces with Jan Betker, Joan McCusker and Marcia Gudereit, forming a foursome of friends, working mothers and Olympic gold medalists. The Caledonian Curling Club, with Schmirler as the skip, or captain, won the provincial title its first season together, 1990-91. The women then won the Canadian and world titles in 1993, 1994 and 1997. Schmirler was six months pregnant when she won the world title in 1996 and was on maternity leave from her job with a recreation center when the team went to the 1998 Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. ""When you have success and you're having fun, it just snowballs and gets bigger and bigger,"" Schmirler said of the team's success. Schmirler's group won the 1998 gold medal by defeating Denmark in Nagano, the first Olympics to make curling an official medal sport. The first athletes from Regina to win an Olympic gold medal became national heroines. Carol Anne Letheren, chief executive officer of the Canadian Olympic Association, said Schmirler ""was a Canadian with whom other Canadians could identify."" Schmirler's team was voted the Canadian Press team of the year for 1998, and she was inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame last March. Shortly after Schmirler gave birth to her second child last summer, following a difficult pregnancy, doctors discovered a malignant tumor in her chest cavity. During surgery last September to remove blood clots, she nearly died on the operating table. Doctors were not able to pinpoint the source of the cancer as she underwent chemotherapy, radiation therapy and other forms of alternative treatment. All the while, the country rallied to support her and help pay for her medical expenses. ""I didn't think I was that good until I started reading all the cards and letters and faxes and e-mails,"" said Schmirler, who died in her sleep at the Pasqua Hospital's Palliative Care Unit. ""All Canadians have been touched by the untimely death of Sandra Schmirler,"" Prime Minister Jean Chretien of Canada said in a statement. ""Most of us came to know her through her exploits as a champion curler and as an exemplary sports ambassador for Canada. But what really set her apart was her bright, engaging personality and her incredible zest for life.""

"NYT",2006,"France","Sans Makeup, S'il Vous Plait","CHIC French women don't wear makeup. At least they pretend not to. Their goal is to glow, with invisible pores and highly polished skin. Too much makeup, French women say, makes a woman seem older, or even worse, as if she makes a living walking the streets. ''It really astonishes me the way American women wear so much makeup,'' said Laura Mercier, the French creator of a line of cosmetics and skin care who lives in New York. ''In America, even teenage girls are overly made-up. And when you are overly made-up, you send out the message that you are overly sexual, that you want to be visible to attract men.'' By contrast, Ms. Mercier said: ''French women are not flashy. They must be subtle. The message must not be, 'I'm spending hours on my face to look beautiful.' '' Michele Fitoussi, one of France's leading social commentators and a columnist at French Elle magazine, described the painted-doll look preferred by many American women with one word: ''vulgaire.'' Certainly, the French delight in defining themselves in opposition to America, no matter what the topic -- food, wine, diplomacy, even beauty. But this attitude is complicated -- a blend of chauvinism and fascination, perhaps with a touch of envy. The French admire the Americans, even as they criticize and dismiss them. A recent issue of French Elle poked fun at what it called the ''too much'' look of the ''California Beauty,'' illustrated by a model in a shocking pink shirt, bicycle shorts, an orange print scarf, mirrored sunglasses, a Louis Vuitton handbag and gaudy gold high-heeled sandals, earrings, necklaces, chain belt, bangles and rings. Nicole Richie and Britney Spears have that overdone look, the French say. Madonna is forgiven since she is seen as a hard-nosed businesswoman and free spirit. Jennifer Lopez doesn't count because she is Hispanic and therefore culturally more exotic. But this disdain is aimed less at specific women than at the overall overdone look. This season, the unadorned look is more in vogue than ever in France. The weekly magazine L'Express calls it ''Le no makeup'' look. French Elle described it this month as ''Le bare face,'' defined as ''nude skin, shimmering slightly.'' To women in France, the too-made-up look represents something more profound than simply one's taste in skin care. It is also the mark of the desperate housewife type who tries too hard. ''The most beautiful makeup for a woman is passion'' is the famous quotation of the designer Yves Saint Laurent. ''But cosmetics are easier to buy.'' Indeed, at the first ''beauty cafe'' in Paris, the talk is about respect, not transformation. For two hours on four recent evenings, the Columbus Cafe -- a rival of Starbucks -- transformed the second floor of its outlet near the Bastille into a place where women came for free lessons about skin care. ''Today beauty is not something only on the surface,'' Sandra Renzi, a cosmetologist with the Darphin skin care line, lectured to women over coffee and Perrier one evening. ''It also comes from inside. Essential oils that contain tiny molecules that penetrate your skin must come first.'' At another session, Sylvie Dutour, a cosmetologist with the Bourjois line, revealed how to respect the eyebrow line and the importance of a lipstick-free mouth if the eyes are shadowed and lined with color. Even for Olivia Hollert, a 22-year-old nurse who considers herself a makeup fanatic, Americans overdo it. ''American girls worship the cult of the 'ideal woman,' '' she said. ''No part of the face seems to be forgotten. And when you use too much makeup, it means you are hiding from yourself.'' In a 2004 poll by the market research group Mintel, 64 percent of American women said they sometimes use foundation, compared with 47 percent of French women; 81 percent of Americans use lipstick compared with 70 percent of French women and 59 percent of Americans use blusher, compared with 43 percent. The image du jour of ''le no makeup'' look is Audrey Tautou. One cover of French Elle this month featured Ms. Tautou, 29, the star of ''The Da Vinci Code,'' without jewelry or any visible makeup except for a slight tint on her lips. Even her beauty marks have not been airbrushed away. Inside the magazine, a full-page photo of her in a frizzy black wig with blackened eyes and red satin cocktail dress bears the caption, ''The Fiancee of Frankenstein.'' The French actresses Juliette Binoche and Nathalie Baye are regularly featured in magazines for embracing the natural look. In politics, the Socialist lawmaker Segolene Royal is busily seducing the country in part because of her grass-roots style, broad smile and fresh-faced look. In some polls on next year's presidential election, she leads the competition. Ms. Royal, 52, who is portrayed as a young politician, wears almost no makeup and brushes her shoulder-length hair often. When she had an upper tooth straightened last year, the daily newspaper Liberation labeled it an un-French act. ''The French people's favorite Socialist is now endowed with an American smile,'' Liberation wrote. That may be because French women still lag far behind Americans in cosmetic surgery and sundry injections to make them appear less flawed (although they are catching up). Catherine Deneuve, for example, with her apparent facial interventions and painted face, is sometimes seen as an object of pity. Ms. Deneuve, 62, the icily beautiful star of ''Belle de Jour,'' was once considered so perfect that she was named France's ''Marianne,'' the idealized embodiment of the French Republic. The face of Chanel in the 1970's, she recently was named the face of MAC's Icon cosmetics line. She admits to wearing makeup even when gardening. ''Poor Catherine,'' said Terry de Gunzburg, creator of the By Terry makeup line. ''She let herself get hooked by the syndrome of Dorian Gray, of eternal youth. It's sad.'' On the whole, French women like to portray themselves as more balanced, more inclined to pamper themselves and take pleasure in daily rituals than Americans. In its most extreme, America is seen as a youth-obsessed, throwaway, quick-fix culture where women are more likely to look artificially young and totally ''done.'' According to this view, sexuality has to be subtle. ''There's always a rapport with the erotic but it's hidden,'' Ms. Fitoussi said. ''The French love mystery, the game of seduction. That's why we respect perfume, why lingerie is so important.'' (A poll in 2003 concluded that 87 percent of French men and women believe that lingerie is an important part of life.) For Ms. Fitoussi, who wears glasses and little makeup, it's all about choosing. Made-up eyes means wearing neutral lipstick. Red lipstick means dressing in black. ''Makeup dates you,'' she said. ''Like a tree.'' Instead, French women invest more time aiming for perfect, blemish-free skin. If there is an obsession, it is tight pores. Even French women of modest means are much more likely than American women to get treatments in spas or clinics that scrub, polish, buff, massage and cream their skins. The French government is complicit. Any woman who can claim to have a medically diagnosed skin condition, from eczema to acne, can receive a regimented ''thermal cure'' at spas in France once a year. The French taxpayer covers as much as 65 percent of the cost. Not everyone agrees that the French emphasis on restraint translates into chic and beautiful women. ''In France, women think they know better than others,'' Ms. de Gunzburg said. ''There is a self-sufficiency, an attitude of 'I don't give a damn what you're telling me.' ''Tell me who's chic here in France? Give me one example. Women don't make any effort here.'' Frenchmen, meanwhile, (who are getting their faces creamed and polished more often) are quick to say they don't like women whose skin color rubs off on their clothes or who look as if they have smeared their lips with tinted Vaseline. That sentiment is not new. The narrator of Marcel Proust's 1927 novel, ''Finding Time Again,'' makes the obviously painted and powdered Gilberte a bit pathetic. ''I sensed that, despite myself, I was staring at her in my curiosity to discover what it was about her that was so changed,'' the narrator says. ''This curiosity was, however, soon satisfied when she wiped her nose, despite all the precautions she employed. From all the colors which remained on the handkerchief, turning it into a rich palette, I saw that she was entirely made-up.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com","CHIC  women don't wear makeup.

''The most beautiful makeup for a woman is passion'' is the famous quotation of the designer . ''But cosmetics are easier to buy.'' Indeed, at the first ''beauty cafe'' in , the talk is about respect, not transformation. For two hours on four recent evenings, the  -- a rival of  -- transformed the second floor of its outlet near the Bastille into a place where women came for free lessons about skin care. ''Today beauty is not something only on the surface,'' , a cosmetologist with the Darphin skin care line, lectured to women over coffee and  one evening. ''It also comes from inside. Essential oils that contain tiny molecules that penetrate your skin must come first.'' At another session, , a cosmetologist with the Bourjois line, revealed how to respect the eyebrow line and the importance of a lipstick-free mouth if the eyes are shadowed and lined with color. Even for , a 22-year-old nurse who considers herself a makeup fanatic, ns overdo it. ''n girls worship the cult of the 'ideal woman,' '' she said. ''No part of the face seems to be forgotten. And when you use too much makeup, it means you are hiding from yourself.'' In a 2004 poll by the market research group , 64 percent of n women said they sometimes use foundation, compared with 47 percent of  women; 81 percent of ns use lipstick compared with 70 percent of  women and 59 percent of ns use blusher, compared with 43 percent. The image du jour of ''le no makeup'' look is . One cover of  this month featured Ms. , 29, the star of ''The Da Vinci Code,'' without jewelry or any visible makeup except for a slight tint on her lips. Even her beauty marks have not been airbrushed away. Inside the magazine, a full-page photo of her in a frizzy black wig with blackened eyes and red satin cocktail dress bears the caption, ''The Fiancee of Frankenstein.'' The  actresses  and  are regularly featured in magazines for embracing the natural look. In politics, the Socialist lawmaker Segolene  is busily seducing the country in part because of her grass-roots style, broad smile and fresh-faced look. In some polls on next year's presidential election, she leads the competition. Ms. , 52, who is portrayed as a young politician, wears almost no makeup and brushes her shoulder-length hair often. When she had an upper tooth straightened last year, the daily newspaper Liberation labeled it an un- act. ''The  people's favorite Socialist is now endowed with an n smile,'' Liberation wrote. That may be because  women still lag far behind ns in cosmetic surgery and sundry injections to make them appear less flawed (although they are catching up). , for example, with her apparent facial interventions and painted face, is sometimes seen as an object of pity. Ms. , 62, the icily beautiful star of '','' was once considered so perfect that she was named 's '','' the idealized embodiment of the . The face of  in the 1970's, she recently was named the face of 's Icon cosmetics line. She admits to wearing makeup even when gardening. ''Poor ,'' said  , creator of the By  makeup line. ''She let herself get hooked by the syndrome of , of eternal youth. It's sad.'' On the whole,  women like to portray themselves as more balanced, more inclined to pamper themselves and take pleasure in daily rituals than ns. In its most extreme,  is seen as a youth-obsessed, throwaway, quick-fix culture where women are more likely to look artificially young and totally ''done.'' According to this view, sexuality has to be subtle. ''There's always a rapport with the erotic but it's hidden,'' Ms.  said. ''The  love mystery, the game of seduction. That's why we respect perfume, why lingerie is so important.'' (A poll in 2003 concluded that 87 percent of  men and women believe that lingerie is an important part of life.) For Ms. , who wears glasses and little makeup, it's all about choosing. Made-up eyes means wearing neutral lipstick. Red lipstick means dressing in black. ''Makeup dates you,'' she said. ''Like a tree.'' Instead,  women invest more time aiming for perfect, blemish-free skin. If there is an obsession, it is tight pores. Even  women of modest means are much more likely than n women to get treatments in spas or clinics that scrub, polish, buff, massage and cream their skins. The  government is complicit. Any woman who can claim to have a medically diagnosed skin condition, from eczema to acne, can receive a regimented ''thermal cure'' at spas in  once a year. The  taxpayer covers as much as 65 percent of the cost. Not everyone agrees that the  emphasis on restraint translates into chic and beautiful women. ''In , women think they know better than others,'' Ms.  said. ''There is a self-sufficiency, an attitude of 'I don't give a damn what you're telling me.' ''Tell me who's chic here in ? Give me one example. Women don't make any effort here.'' men, meanwhile, (who are getting their faces creamed and polished more often) are quick to say they don't like women whose skin color rubs off on their clothes or who look as if they have smeared their lips with tinted Vaseline. That sentiment is not new. The narrator of 's 1927 novel, ''Finding Time Again,'' makes the obviously painted and powdered  a bit pathetic. ''I sensed that, despite myself, I was staring at her in my curiosity to discover what it was about her that was so changed,'' the narrator says. ''This curiosity was, however, soon satisfied when she wiped her nose, despite all the precautions she employed. From all the colors which remained on the handkerchief, turning it into a rich palette, I saw that she was entirely made-up.''  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"
"NYT",1981,"Saudi Arabia","SAUDI MEN STILL HOLD FIRM REIN, BUT WOMEN HAVE EASIER TIME","Fawzan wears the traditional head-to-toe veil, but in her furniture store she appears in fashionable European clothing. ''If a woman in Saudi Arabia wants to work, she can,'' Mrs. Fawzan said. ''The veil won't stop you. In running a business I am contributing to the economic growth of Saudi Arabia, and I am doing so by observing all our Islamic traditions and practices.'' As the Saudis race to invest their oil riches in ambitious economic-development programs, the roles played by Mrs. Fawzan and many other urban women indicate that the traditionally conservative Islamic social structure is gradually yielding to change. Nonetheless, many restrictions remain on women in this country of perhaps 10 million people. Despite the insistence of Saudi religious leaders that women enjoy equality with men in the Islamic world, the situation is clearly weighted in favor of Saudi men. Women are not allowed to work with men, and no one is predicting the early lifting of this prohibition. Women and men are not permitted to swim together. Socializing is frowned upon; even in private, it is said, few unmarried women will venture to mix with unattached Saudi men without the presence of a family-approved chaperone. Most marriages are still arranged, sometimes with cousins. Women who travel are required to be accompanied by close male relatives, who have the traditional right to see them unveiled. Virtually all women feel compelled by custom to wear the veil in public. A woman needs the approval of the senior male member of her family to start or own a business. Mrs. Fawzan had to obtain the written authorization of her husband; a commercial license was then issued by the Government. Among educated women in such cities as Riyadh, Jidda, Taif, Dhahran and Dammam there is some grumbling about the restrictions. Some women maintain, in particular, that keeping the bans on individual travel and on driving is irrational and that it confuses tradition and religion. The changes concerning the status of women and the opportunities available to them largely apply to urban women, whose proportion of the female population is indeterminate because of the absence of official census figures. In the nomadic desert communities, officials say, it will be a long time before change takes place, at least partly because of pervasive illiteracy. Education is not mandatory, and while urban families may feel compelled to send their children to school, that compulsion hardly exists in rural areas, which also suffer from a lack of schools. As for the veil, in interviews across the country remarkably few women objected to it vigorously.  ''The veil is protection for our bodies - it is not a prison for our minds,'' said Cecile I. Rouchdy, headmistress of the Dar al-Hannan girls' school in Jidda. Fatamma al-Awsiyeh, a 20-year-old resident of Jidda who has a job in a bank run by women, agreed that the veil offered ''Islamic-style protection,'' but she added that ''the way it is done here is an intrusion.'' Asked whether she felt otherwise restricted, she said that life for women was generally unrestricted within the household and that she, like other affluent Saudi women, frequently traveled abroad with her family. ''The freedoms I would like are to be able to drive and to travel on my own,'' she added. The changes taking place are manifest in increasing educational and employment opportunities for women - opportunities that, in effect, are being provided within a wholly separate and selfcontained sector where there is little contact with men. Like Mrs. Fawzan, scores of women are becoming entrepreneurs, scores more are entering educational careers and increasing numbers are physicians, administrators in governmental agencies and members of bank staffs. A third of the 16,000 students at Riyadh University are women, according to the president, Dr. Mansur al-Turki. Perhaps half the Saudi physicians are women, and more than 500,000 girls attend primary and secondary schools, according to Mrs. Rouchdy, the Jidda headmistress, who said that the number of girls attending primary and secondary schools - another indeterminate statistic - was increasing by 25 percent annually. ''It is true that change has been tremendous, and its impact on women is far-reaching,'' said Dr. Fatma Mandily, vice dean of the University Studies Center for Girls at Riyadh University. ''We are fortunate that this change has taken place within the framework of our Islamic traditions and the old code of ethics. Their modernization, so to speak, has made Saudi women more sociable, more openminded and more open-hearted. Yet we are still adhering to our Islamic way of life.'' Although there has been resistance to such change from some segments of the powerful religious hierarchy, the developments of the last few years have, by and large, been acquiesced in by the religious leaders, who shape much of policy. Dr. Mahmoud M. Safar, Deputy Minister for Higher Education and one of the Government's most articulate spokesmen, said: ''We have already passed the stage of such questions as to whether we should let our women work or not. We have no illusions about the contributions Saudi women can make to the development of our country. But our great challenge is to allow her to work and at the same time to maintain the characteristics of the Moslem woman.'' What this means is that beyond the overall Government policy of encouraging female literacy and education, there are few specifics concerning the promotion of employment or career opportunities for women. A Government commission is reportedly examining areas of work to be officially approved for women. Women who run boutiques or beauty parlors may run the risk of having their businesses closed down, even if temporarily, by the so-called religious police or members of the Society for the Preservation of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice. The recently disclosed third five-year plan calls for the participation of women in the development of the country, although few specifics are offered. Officials such as the Minister of Planning, Hisham Nazir, one of the most prominent technicians, are known to espouse the position that since more than 50 percent of the potential labor force of 2.5 million are female, the increased employment of women could help Saudi Arabia become less reliant on foreign labor. Women have traditionally been employed in such areas as teaching and nursing. ''But as more of us travel and see the kinds of opportunities available to women elsewhere, there is a feeling that educated women could contribute in more fields in Saudi Arabia,'' said Mrs. Fawzan, the furniture store owner. Fatimah Khalil Deffaa, who is in charge of the women's banking center at the Saudi American Bank, formerly Citibank, here, reports that when her agency opened for business six months ago she was flooded with applications. Wasisa Hakim, 23, who recently returned from Britain after earning her high school diploma, has joined the Saudi American Bank as a teller and works in the women's section. Driven to work the family chauffeur, she wears a veil outdoors. ''I wanted to work because I am determined to do something with my time and my life,'' Miss Hakim said. ''Women's banking represents a step forward for the role of women in our kingdom.'' She expressed concern about what Westernization: ''We think about this Westernization process a lot, and among some of us there is concern about Western influence. When we go abroad for education and come back, it doesn't mean we are Westernized. People like me take education to develop ourselves and for the ultimate benefit of our country. That does not mean we forget our culture.'' Miss Hakim is among those women who believe it essential for their country to ease out the large numbers of foreign workers, of whom there are at least 2.5 million, to preserve a conservative, traditional culture with its own special character. Miss Hakim, stating that she did not feel restricted by society, said: ''People ask, 'Why don't single women get to meet single men without an escort?' Well, it is not in our tradition to meet men that way. We have freedom up to a point. I don't think our women should go as far as Western women do. We don't usually discuss things like politics, for instance, but these are things that as women don't concern us.'' Another Saudi woman at the bank, 20-year-old Basama al-Owssiy, who was queried about marriage, replied: ''Ask God. The right person hasn't come along. I would like to build a career, and I think that is possible along with marriage responsibilities. If the right person comes along, I can reach agreement with him. I can't see him having any objections to my working. I don't want to be simply a housewife and stay at home.'' A number of women say that the key to change is more education.  ''Education is the basis of the change that is taking place in Saudi society for women,'' Mrs. Rouchdy said. ''But for the most part Saudi women do not want to change their social norms. They don't want to run away from Islamic values and from religion. They are saying, We don't want the superficial aspects of Westernization but only the scientific part of it.'' She said that one factor encouraging parents to send daughters to school was concern that many young men who traveled abroad for education returned with foreign wives. Noting that Saudi women's education started barely 20 years ago, she added, ''We have come a very long way.''"," wears the traditional head-to-toe veil, but in her furniture store she appears in fashionable European clothing.

"NYT",2010,"Saudi Arabia","Saudi Women And the Right To Play Sports","After the 18-year-old Saudi equestrian Dalma Malhas won a bronze medal in show jumping at the first Youth Olympic Games in Singapore in August, she was singled out for praise by Jacques Rogge, chairman of the International Olympic Committee, in a news conference at the Games' conclusion. ''This is indeed the first time that a Saudi woman is participating in an international event,'' let alone winning a medal, Mr. Rogge said of Olympic events. Ms. Malhas's achievement, he said, had made the I.O.C. ''absolutely happy.'' The reaction in Ms. Malhas's conservative Muslim homeland -- where sports for women are seen in some quarters as immodest, even immoral -- has been far more complicated. Physical exercise of any kind is forbidden in Saudi Arabia's state-run schools for girls. Though gyms for women exist in major Saudi cities, they are usually unmarked, so that customers need not fear attracting attention. Saudi Arabia does not permit women to represent it in international athletic competitions, and it is one of only three countries that has yet to send women to the Olympic Games. (The others are Qatar and Brunei.) Although Saudi Arabia sent an official delegation of male athletes to Singapore for the Youth Olympics, Ms. Malhas -- the daughter of an accomplished female show jumper, Arwa Mutabagani -- had to enter on her own, at her own expense. Now her bronze medal has placed her at the center of a growing controversy in the kingdom about what kinds of athletic activity, if any, are acceptable for Saudi girls and women. The laws and customs that govern the lives of Saudi women are among the most restrictive anywhere. Public separation of the sexes is stringent. Saudi women may not drive or vote and must wear floor-length cloaks known as abayas and head scarves whenever they leave home. They may not appear in court. But in recent years, women's issues have become a major battleground between liberals and conservatives. Saudi traditions regarding the rights and treatment of women have rarely, if ever, been so much in dispute. The issue of Saudi women in sports is a manifestation of this larger debate. On July 31, the Saudi dissident Ali al-Ahmed, who directs the Institute for Gulf Affairs in Washington, started a campaign called ''No Women. No Play,'' urging the I.O.C. to suspend Saudi Arabia from Olympic competition until it allowed female participation. In a telephone interview, Mr. Ahmed likened the position of Saudi women today to that of blacks in apartheid-era South Africa and asked why the I.O.C. had not suspended Saudi Arabia from the Games as it banned South Africa from 1964 through the end of apartheid in the early 1990s. ''Even more than political pressure, the expulsion of South Africa from the Olympics was one of the most effective tools for ending apartheid,'' Mr. Ahmed said, without referring to the more prominent role accorded sports over all in South African society, or whether an Olympic ban would have the same effect in Saudi Arabia. ''The freedom to practice sports and to exercise is such a very basic issue,'' Mr. Ahmed said. ''It has to do with physical health. I think that once Saudi women are free to practice sports, that will open up other areas of discussion about their rights.'' The Olympic charter states that ''the practice of sport is a human right'' and that ''any form of discrimination with regard to a country or a person on grounds of race, religion, politics, gender or otherwise is incompatible with belonging to the Olympic movement.'' A spokeswoman for the I.O.C., Emmanuelle Moreau, indicated in an e-mail that the I.O.C. had no intention of formally censuring countries that did not allow women to participate in the Olympics. She said the organization did not plan to give Saudi Arabia a deadline, as it did with apartheid-era South Africa. ''The I.O.C. strives to ensure the Olympic Games and the Olympic movement are universal and nondiscriminatory,'' Ms. Moreau said. She added about their current policy: ''National Olympic committees are encouraged to uphold that spirit in their delegations. The I.O.C. does not give ultimatums nor deadlines, but rather believes that a lot can be achieved through dialogue.'' Outside of Olympic teams, there have been signs of change for Saudi sportswomen. In major cities, a handful of private basketball and soccer teams for women have sprung up. In 2008, Ms. Mutabagani was made a board member of Saudi Arabia's Equestrian Federation, the first such post for a woman in Saudi sports. Saudi newspaper columnists have argued that relaxing the prohibitions against physical exercise might help to stem exploding levels of obesity and osteoporosis among Saudi women. Lina al-Maeena, who in 2003 founded Jeddah United, a women's basketball team that has since grown into a full-fledged sports training and management company, agrees. ''You have very high rates of diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis for women, a very high rate of depression,'' she said. ''You have this conservative segment here that's using religion to oppose women's sports. But that's a very invalid argument.'' She hopes that pressure from the I.O.C. may help to break down the barriers to women's athletic participation. ''At the end of the day, the Olympic charter does state that there shall be no discrimination based on gender, religion or ethnicity,'' she said. ''And Saudi Arabia is obviously not following the Olympic charter.'' Liberal Saudis note that even Aisha, the young wife of the prophet Muhammad, is reported to have enjoyed footraces against her husband and that conservative Muslim societies like Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates have more open attitudes about women and sports. Last year, the daily newspaper Al-Riyadh reported that a survey of 2,250 Saudis found that a mere 4 percent were opposed to gyms for girls and women. But majority opinion counts for little in an absolute monarchy, in which the king rules in concert with a fundamentalist religious establishment. Some of the most prominent clerics continue to oppose sports for women under all circumstances, arguing that sports will lead them to engage in behavior like wearing immodest clothing or leaving their homes unnecessarily. Other clerics argue that sports are absolutely off limits only for virgins, who could become unmarriageable if they were to damage their hymens through athletic activity. ''Women should be housewives,'' the grand mufti told the Saudi channel Al Eqtisadiah. ''There is no need for them to engage in sports.'' Female Saudi athletes say they find it unproductive to debate views openly. ''I don't want to provoke people,'' Ms. Mutabagani said. ''The conservative side always says: 'No, you should be at home. You shouldn't be traveling, you shouldn't be competing in public.' '' Ms. Mutabagani wears a veil when she is representing Saudi Arabia overseas as an official of the federation and said she always tried to emphasize, in interviews, the less controversial aspects of women's sports, like the importance of exercise for health. ''I try to respect our culture,'' she said. ''You don't want to create a negative opinion of women in sport.'' Ms. Maeena said that looking at women's movements globally helped her stay optimistic. ''It's not just in Saudi that sports for women are a political issue,'' she said. ''Up until 1972 with the Title IX, women in the U.S. didn't really get equal rights in sports. And that's, what, three decades ago? And it's a 250-year old country. ''We're only a 78-year-old country,'' she continued. ''When you gauge yourself from the historical perspective, you see that the process Saudi Arabia is going through is a very normal process that all societies have gone through in relation to different fields of endeavor for women.''","After the 18-year-old  equestrian Dalma  won a bronze medal in show jumping at the first Youth Olympic Games in  in August, she was singled out for praise by Jacques , chairman of the , in a news conference at the Games' conclusion.

In 2008, Ms.  was made a board member of 's , the first such post for a woman in  sports.  newspaper columnists have argued that relaxing the prohibitions against physical exercise might help to stem exploding levels of obesity and osteoporosis among  women. , who in 2003 founded , a women's basketball team that has since grown into a full-fledged sports training and management company, agrees. ''You have very high rates of diabetes, obesity and osteoporosis for women, a very high rate of depression,'' she said. ''You have this conservative segment here that's using religion to oppose women's sports. But that's a very invalid argument.'' She hopes that pressure from the  may help to break down the barriers to women's athletic participation. ''At the end of the day, the Olympic charter does state that there shall be no discrimination based on gender, religion or ethnicity,'' she said. ''And  is obviously not following the Olympic charter.'' Liberal s note that even , the young wife of the prophet , is reported to have enjoyed footraces against her husband and that conservative Muslim societies like  and the  have more open attitudes about women and sports. Last year, the daily newspaper  reported that a survey of 2,250 s found that a mere 4 percent were opposed to gyms for girls and women. But majority opinion counts for little in an absolute monarchy, in which the king rules in concert with a fundamentalist religious establishment. Some of the most prominent clerics continue to oppose sports for women under all circumstances, arguing that sports will lead them to engage in behavior like wearing immodest clothing or leaving their homes unnecessarily. Other clerics argue that sports are absolutely off limits only for virgins, who could become unmarriageable if they were to damage their hymens through athletic activity. ''Women should be housewives,'' the grand mufti told the  channel . ''There is no need for them to engage in sports.'' Female  athletes say they find it unproductive to debate views openly. ''I don't want to provoke people,'' Ms.  said. ''The conservative side always says: 'No, you should be at home. You shouldn't be traveling, you shouldn't be competing in public.' '' Ms.  wears a veil when she is representing  overseas as an official of the federation and said she always tried to emphasize, in interviews, the less controversial aspects of women's sports, like the importance of exercise for health. ''I try to respect our culture,'' she said. ''You don't want to create a negative opinion of women in sport.'' Ms. Maeena said that looking at women's movements globally helped her stay optimistic. ''It's not just in  that sports for women are a political issue,'' she said. ''Up until 1972 with the Title IX, women in the U.S. didn't really get equal rights in sports. And that's, what, three decades ago? And it's a 250-year old country. ''We're only a 78-year-old country,'' she continued. ''When you gauge yourself from the historical perspective, you see that the process  is going through is a very normal process that all societies have gone through in relation to different fields of endeavor for women.''"
"NYT",2011,"Saudi Arabia","Saudi Women Defy Driving Ban","Updated | 3:15 p.m. Although random acts of women driving were reported in major cities across Saudi Arabia on Friday, the protest against the longstanding ban appears to have been smaller than initially anticipated after the Saudi government imprisoned a main organizer for nine days last month. Scattered reports by social media and an informal network of activists suggested that the number of women who drove was in the dozens, with few incidents of confrontations with either the traffic or the morals police reported. At least half a dozen women who were stopped were escorted home and admonished not to drive again, said activists reached by telephone. Maha al-Qahtani, an information technology specialist for the government, drove around Riyadh in clear weather for 45 minutes with her husband, Mohamed, a human rights activist, in the car. She braced for a siren after passing each of about five police cars, she said, but they ignored her. ""I woke up today believing with every part of me that this is my right, I woke up believing this is my duty and I was no longer afraid,"" said Mrs. Qahtani, adding that she brought a change of clothes and a prayer rug with her in case she was detained. Later in the day, Mrs. Qahtani's husband reported on Twitter that his wife was stopped by the police during a subsequent trip along King Fahad Road in Riyadh, and ticketed for driving without a license. She posted a photograph of the ticket on Yfrog. Lynsey Addario, an American photojournalist who was with the Qahtanis on their later drive, reported on Twitter that they were stopped by six police cars. She observed: ""You would think they caught Zawahiri, or someone else from [Al] Qaeda. How dangerous woman drivers are."" She was referring to Ayman al-Zawahri, the new leader of Al Qaeda. About 15 minutes later, Ms. Addario added, ""They let us go. Police didn't know what to do, so gave the woman a ticket for not having a license."" According to her husband, Mrs. Qahtani who is licensed to drive, but outside Saudi Arabia. Later in the day Ahmed Al Omran, a Saudi blogger and journalist who is working with N.P.R. in Washington reported that Mrs. Qahtani told him that ""she won't pay the ticket she got, she will instead frame it and hang it on the wall."" From its inception in April, the protest was not meant to be a mass driving effort. Rather, women with legal driving licenses from other countries were urged to run mundane errands - going to the grocery store, taking their kids someplace - in order to underscore the fact that women driving is a normal right. Manal al-Sharif, a 32-year-old single mother, started the call for the June 17 protest in April with a Facebook page and Twitter feed. But after posting video of herself driving around Al-Khobar in Eastern Province, she was arrested in late May and unexpectedly thrown in jail for nine days. Many supporters were disappointed, feeling that she had jumped the gun and jeopardized them all by taking a confrontational approach. Before her arrest, Ms. Sharif had encouraged other women to follow her example and document their acts of ""driving while female"" by posting video online. A small number of clips and still photographs posted on Facebook and YouTube by activists on Friday appeared to show female hands steering cars through the kingdom's streets. One video, which appears to have been recorded just after midnight on Friday, begins with an image of a woman's iPhone displaying Friday's date. A woman wearing a niqab as she sits at the wheel says: ""Today is Friday June 17th. I would like to go to supermarket. I feel I can go anywhere I want and it feels so great. If I need anything, I am able to go and get it myself. I am loving this experience. I think its time for society to accept us driving."" There were, however, signs that efforts were being made to stifle news of the protest. One video, posted on YouTube earlier on Friday showing female hands on a steering wheel, was later deleted from YouTube. Sara al-Bassam, a blogger who used her Twitter feed to point to reports of women who took to the streets, explained that she was not playing a more active role, by driving herself, only because, as ""a direct result of the ban: I don't know how to."" Women driving remains a sensitive issue in Saudi Arabia. For religious conservatives, it is a kind of Alamo, the ban a sign that the kingdom still holds to its traditions and has not caved to Western pressure. The ruling family has been especially dependent on this base of supporters in recent months as protests erupted across the region. The mufti, the highest religious figure in the kingdom, rolled out a fatwa banning protests, a called echoed forcefully by mosque preachers. Many Saudi activists considered the harsh treatment of Ms. Sharif a warning from the monarchy against trying to organize any kind of movement via social media. The initiative for women to drive was the strongest effort so far in the kingdom inspired by the regional climate. ""Women in Saudi Arabia see other women in the Middle East making revolutions, women in Yemen and Egypt at the forefront of revolutions, being so bold, toppling entire governments,"" said Waleed Abu Alkhair, whose wife drove around Jidda, even though he was out of the country. ""The women Saudi Arabia looked at themselves and they realized 'Wow! We can't even drive!'"" Mr. Abu Alkhair said he knew about a score of women who drove, and aside from one being questioned by the police for two hours before being released, none were bothered. Maj. Gen. Mansour al-Turki, the spokesman for the Interior Ministry, could not be reached for comment. Once the campaign had been announced, there were frequent threats by opponents to punish the women who drove either by beating them or smashing their cars. ""We want women to keep fighting this fight and to be free, it will help to liberate the entire society,"" Mr. Abu Alkhair said. One protester, speaking anonymously because she signed a religious police confession that said she would not drive again, said that transportation seemed like a pretty small issue compared to the demands in other Arab states but that even ""a small fight would be revolutionary for Saudi Arabia."" On Twitter, a number of Saudi women claimed to have driven on Friday - although those reports were impossible to verify independently. Several women also reported receiving support from Saudi men, and there were even a few jokes. ""I'll be arriving to Riyadh in the evening,"" quipped Khalid Khalifa, a comedian. ""Any ladies free around that time to pick me up from the airport?"" In the weeks after Ms. Sharif's arrest, a debate erupted between those religious clerics and their conservative followers who oppose women driving and the kingdom's increasingly outspoken women. Opponents largely argued that Saudi society was not ready for it, and that a woman should not be thrown into the wilds of Saudi driving habits nor held responsible for any accidents. Worse, opponents argue that it will lead to the public mingling of the sexes. Supporters mock the clerics for putting everything in a sexual context and wonder aloud why it is O.K. for Saudi women to be driven around by an army of about 800,000 foreign men from Southeast Asia imported as drivers. When a cleric in Eastern Province, Sheik Mohammed al-Monajid, branded Ms. Sharif ""fasika,""  which translates as amoral or loose, his surname became a hashtag on Twitter as critics poured on the scorn. After another woman, Najla Hariri, said that she had driven around Jidda, a commercial city on the Red Sea coast known for its more liberal ways, she appeared as a guest on a television program on the Daleel satellite channel, debating Sheik Walid al-Rushdy, a cleric opposed to women driving. When he pressed her about how often she had been harassed by men, Ms. Hariri stated that other drivers either flashed signs of encouragement or ignored her. The sheik responded that Ms. Hariri must be ""qawaa'id,"" a classical Arabic term for a woman beyond the age of sexual desirability. ""Well at least you didn't call me a prostitute,"" shot back Ms. Hariri, since women drivers are often categorized thus by the clergy. Opposition was not limited to the clergy, nor men. ""Not all women in Saudi want to drive; the majority of women are against it,"" said Tala al-Hejaylan, a woman who is a lawyer in Eastern Province.  ""There needs to be a dialogue among Saudi Arabian women themselves before undertaking such drastic, counterproductive rebellious displays like today."" Open confrontation with the ruling family and the clerics will not speed the advance of women's rights, she said. Many women argue that driving distracts from more important issues, like ending the male guardianship, which gives men control over every aspect of women's lives. Although the arrest of Ms. Sharif discouraged women from driving, the fact that it enlivened the debate was in marked contrast to the first (and last) such protest in November 1990. Clerics branded the 47 women amoral and the Saud monarchy confiscated their passports, firing those working for the government. Many went into isolation for their own safety and the issue was shelved for years. Aside from the issue of religious opposition, Saudis also question aloud whether the continued ban boils down to a business proposition. There are widespread suspicions in the country that those who controls the visa process - and in Saudi Arabia that means the princes of the ruling family - have made a business out of controlling the black market in visas for drivers, which can cost more than $3,000 apiece. Many young married couples decry the fact that they cannot afford that, not to mention the monthly salary for a driver of about $600. The more liberal princes support allowing women to drive. Prince Talal bin Abdel Aziz, 79 and long among the most outspoken members of the royal family, argues that such reforms lag in the kingdom because the leading members of the royal family have failed to pass any power or influence down to the younger generations. ""Bravo to the women!"" the prince said in an interview. ""Why should women drive in the countryside and not in the cities?"" Women have long driven in rural areas of Saudi Arabia. King Abdullah and other key royals have said in interviews with foreign reporters that they expected Saudi women to drive one day soon, but they have been mute amidst the current debate. This week, Brian Whitaker, a journalist who writes for The Guardian, looked at the possible wider implications of the driving protest in a post on his blog headlined ""Rise of the Muslim Sisterhood?"" Mr. Whitaker observed: So far, the Saudi regime has escaped the kind of protests seen in a number of other Arab countries. It has declared street demonstrations to be un-Islamic and well as illegal, and is well-equipped to deal with them ... assuming the protesters are men. The one thing it is not prepared for, and would probably have difficulty coping with, is a mass revolt by women. And why bother preparing for that? Women, after all, are expected to obey their menfolk and not trouble their heads with things like politics. Saudi women, of course, have plenty to revolt about. They are oppressed, discriminated against and kept apart - excluded from many of the activities that for men would be normal. Paradoxically, though, the patriarchal system that keeps them apart from men also gives them a unique kind of freedom to organize and agitate beyond the gaze of male eyes (which inevitably includes most of the state's surveillance system). Neil MacFarquhar reported from Cairo, and Robert Mackey contributed reporting from New York.","Updated | 3:15 p.m. Although random acts of women driving were reported in major cities across  on Friday, the protest against the longstanding ban appears to have been smaller than initially anticipated after the  government imprisoned a main organizer for nine days last month.

"WP",2006,"Saudi Arabia","Saudi Women Rise in Defense of the Veil; Some Conservatives Fear U.S.-Led Erosion of Traditional Islamic Values","More than 500 women packed the Saudi capital's Maimouna Center on a recent evening to attend a lecture. The women, some still in their full black wraps, filled the rows of plum-colored plastic chairs, while late arrivals sat in small clusters on the carpet and against the wall. ""Whom do we love?"" asked the lecturer, a woman, seated behind a desk on a raised platform. ""God,"" the women answered in unison. ""Then we must obey Him."" She went on to urge the audience members to dress modestly and raise their daughters to do the same. She explained that, despite what some Saudis are now saying, it is a sin for men and women to mix. ""Even if people don't see you sin, God is watching,"" she warned. ""On Judgment Day, your own skin will testify against you."" As she took copious notes, Mashael al-Eissa dabbed at tears, overcome by the extent of her religious responsibilities. Eissa, a fiery young Internet writer, and the lecturer, Afrah al-Humaydi, are among a group of conservative Saudi women trying to redress what they view as an erosion of traditional values in the kingdom and a dangerous shift in the status of women. ""Saudi women are the luckiest in the world and Saudi Arabia is the closest thing to an ideal and pure Islamic nation,"" Eissa said. ""We don't want imported Western values to destroy that."" The changes that have so riled Eissa and other conservative women followed the intense scrutiny that Saudi Arabia received after the discovery that 15 of the 19 hijackers who carried out the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks in the United States were Saudis. The lack of personal liberties in the kingdom  --  an absolute monarchy that imposes a strict form of Islam  --  was widely held to be an underlying part of the extremist ideology the attackers shared. Shortly afterward, strict censorship of the media was loosened and subjects that the religious establishment had placed off-limits for decades, such as the ban on women driving or working alongside men, were openly debated. Women, previously hidden, started appearing as television newscasters, and their photos became daily staples in the press. King Abdullah, crowned in August, called for increased work opportunities for women and started including female journalists, professors and business leaders on his trips overseas. And during regional tours last year, both Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and Undersecretary of State Karen Hughes said Saudi women needed broader political rights to make changes in their lives. But the new atmosphere has alarmed conservative women who are suspicious of U.S. interference and warn that changes in their status could destroy the country's Islamic framework. Though no figures are available, conservative, religious women seem to constitute a sizable portion of the country's female population, belying notions that most Saudi women are unhappy with their lot and waiting to be liberated. On the contrary, the black veil and the prohibition against women driving are embraced by many women here as a form of protection and an integral part of their religion. Faiza al-Obaidi, a biology professor, says she thinks the attempts at Western-style female emancipation are part of a religious war being waged by the United States, ""an intellectual rather than physical colonization."" Sitting at the food court at the Basateen Mall in the coastal city of Jiddah one weekend, lifting her veil to take bites from a tuna sandwich, she said the West was targeting women, the core of society, as a means of eventually controlling the whole country. ""They fear Islam, and we are the world's foremost Islamic nation,"" she said. Obaidi shows pride in her religion and resists foreign interference, she said, by maintaining her veil, or niqab. ""Just because this is closed,"" she said, tugging at the black material that covered her face, ""doesn't mean this is,"" pointing to her head. Samia Adham, a statistics professor seated beside her, also in a veil, added: ""This is a choice. We choose to be ruled by Islam. We will make changes, but within our religion and in our own way."" Two young men with long hair and wearing bright T-shirts and frayed jeans entered the food court and sat at a table with a young woman. Obaidi shook her head. ""You wouldn't have seen that several years ago,"" she said. Many Salafi women here, who follow the school of thought that calls for a return to Islam as practiced by the prophet Muhammad and the following two generations, shatter the stereotype of women in black niqab as meek and submissive. Often well educated, articulate and sometimes downright aggressive, they include award-winning scientists, writers and college professors. Khadija Badahdah, a university administrator who holds a doctorate in chemistry from the University of London and wears a veil, said she recently started to grant television interviews because women calling for change were dominating coverage on the airwaves and in newspapers and giving the wrong impression of Saudi women. ""They are a minority but they appear to speak for all of us,"" she said, sitting in her comfortable home in Jiddah on a recent weekend. ""This is the beginning of a cultural erosion, and if we don't fight it now, it will continue."" The Salafi women have also used lectures and Internet and newspaper campaigns to combat what they view as negative developments. Though they appear to be fighting against women's rights, they say they are actually fighting for the rights granted to women in Islam. Humaydi, the lecturer, says she counsels women to educate themselves for at least half an hour a day about their rights under Islamic law. The problems faced by Saudi women, she said, are not because of Islam, which she calls a perfect religion that honors and values women. The fault lies in its improper implementation. ""We were given rights by Islam 1,400 years ago that women in the West only got at the beginning of the 20th century,"" said Humaydi, a middle-aged college professor. ""Muslim women can work, and inherit, and be financially independent."" But working alongside men, taking leadership positions or removing the veil are choices that the religious women say are not open to them. This year a Gallup poll in eight predominantly Muslim countries found that only in Saudi Arabia did the majority of women not agree that women should be allowed to hold political office. Last summer, 500 women addressed a letter to Abdullah asking him to save the country from the onslaught of Westernized ideas regarding women and to maintain the ban on women driving and working with men. Men and women should not share work spaces, Humaydi contends, because Islam says not to place oneself in an environment where adultery can occur. ""People are wonderful, but the devil doesn't sit still,"" she said, adding that even Bill Clinton, while president, ""couldn't resist him."" At Jiddah's King Fahd Medical Research Center, a small Casio recorder played Koranic verses in the background as Faten Khorshid peered through a microscope, her niqab falling past her shoulders over her long white lab coat. Khorshid, who received a government grant for cancer research, says that her conservative views have not held her back and that the niqab makes it easier for doctors to concentrate on work instead of one another. ""I don't want to be the equal of a man,"" she added. ""In many ways, I am better than him.""","More than 500 women packed the  capital's  on a recent evening to attend a lecture.

Faiza al-, a biology professor, says she thinks the attempts at ern-style female emancipation are part of a religious war being waged by the , ""an intellectual rather than physical colonization.""

""You wouldn't have seen that several years ago,"" she said. Many Salafi women here, who follow the school of thought that calls for a return to Islam as practiced by the prophet  and the following two generations, shatter the stereotype of women in black niqab as meek and submissive. Often well educated, articulate and sometimes downright aggressive, they include award-winning scientists, writers and college professors. , a university administrator who holds a doctorate in chemistry from the  and wears a veil, said she recently started to grant television interviews because women calling for change were dominating coverage on the airwaves and in newspapers and giving the wrong impression of  women.

""This is the beginning of a cultural erosion, and if we don't fight it now, it will continue."" The Salafi women have also used lectures and Internet and newspaper campaigns to combat what they view as negative developments.

"NYT",2005,"Iraq","SECULAR IRAQIS SAY NEW CHARTER MAY CURB RIGHTS","Some secular Iraqi leaders complained Tuesday that the country's nearly finished constitution lays the groundwork for the possible domination of the country by Shiite Islamic clerics, and that it contains specific provisions that could sharply curtail the rights of women. The secular leaders said the draft, which was presented to the National Assembly on Monday, contains language that not only establishes the primacy of Islam as the country's official religion, but appears to grant judges wide latitude to strike down legislation that may contravene the faith. To interpret such legislation, the constitution calls for the appointment of experts in Shariah, or Islamic law, to preside on the Supreme Federal Court. The draft constitution, these secular Iraqis say, clears the way for religious authorities to adjudicate personal disputes like divorce and inheritance matters by allowing the establishment of religious courts, raising fears that a popularly elected Islamist-minded government could enact legislation and appoint judges who could turn the country into a theocracy. The courts would rely on Shariah, which under most interpretations grants women substantially fewer rights than men. Language reserving a quarter of the Assembly's seats for women has been relegated to a section of the constitution labeled transitional, which is of uncertain legal force and duration. Another phrase declares that education is mandatory only through elementary school. Women's rights groups, which expressed concern about lower levels of literacy among women here, wanted middle school to be declared mandatory as well, but were defeated. President Bush, in an appearance in Idaho on Tuesday, asserted that the Iraqi document guaranteed women's rights and the freedom of religion in a country that in recent decades had only known dictatorship. Labeling the Iraqi constitution an ''amazing event,'' he said, ''We had a little trouble with our own conventions writing a constitution.'' The Iraqi constitution, several weeks in the making, is still not in its final form. After weeks of deliberations and an extension of its deadline, a group of Iraqi leaders submitted an incomplete draft to the Assembly on Monday night. The leaders gave themselves until Thursday to work out the remaining disputes. According to Shiite and Kurdish leaders, who wrote most of the document, none of those differences involved questions of Islam or women's rights. Many Iraqis say they are already concerned at the strengthening grip of political Islam in many areas of southern Iraq, where alcohol is banned in many places, women are forced to dress conservatively and religious minorities often feel compelled to mimic those in the majority. Most of the cities of southern Iraq have fallen under the sway of the same Shiite political parties that make up the ruling coalition in Baghdad, one that many people believe has a good chance at capturing a majority of Assembly seats in the elections scheduled for December. ''This is the future of the new Iraqi government -- it will be in the hands of the clerics,'' said Dr. Raja Kuzai, a secular Shiite member of the Assembly. ''I wanted Iraqi women to be free, to be able to talk freely and to able to move around.'' ''I am not going to stay here,'' said Dr. Kuzai, an obstetrician and women's leader who met President Bush in the White House in November 2003. Other Iraqi leaders who helped draft the constitution say the fears of nascent theocracy are unfounded. The new draft constitution, they point out, contains language guaranteeing equal rights for all Iraqis, as well as freedom of expression and religion. And it contains important safeguards, such as, in some cases, the requirement of super-majorities to approve laws. Ahmad Chalabi, the deputy prime minister, said the Iraqi draft constitution erected a more stringent separation of state and religion than any such document in the Middle East. Mr. Chalabi said the new language allowing a clerical role in family disputes was inserted by popular demand, and that, in any case, any Iraqi would be free to reject it and opt for a secular court. ''There is no compulsion; they are free to do whatever they want,'' said Mr. Chalabi, the former White House favorite who has recently moved closer to Islamist politicians like Moktada al-Sadr. ''There was much discontent among people because they were forced to follow laws they didn't believe in.'' Asked about the possibility of a theocratic government in Iraq, the American ambassador here, Zalmay Khalilzad, argued that the document strives for a balance of authority among Islam, human rights and democracy. ''The draft contains far-reaching democratic and human rights commitments,'' he said during a news conference. ''It's a synthesis between Islamic traditions of the country with the universal principles of democracy and human rights, and in that sense, it sets a new path for the future.'' The Shiite and Kurdish leaders who bear primary responsibility for drafting the document have given public assurances that the new constitution would protect individual rights, and that they have built safeguards into the draft to ensure that Iraq will not become theocracy. Mr. Khalilzad acknowledged the limits of American influence here, saying it was not the intention of the Bush administration to impose what would amount to a Western constitution on a country with a different history and tradition. ''These are decisions that Iraqis have made for themselves,'' he said. ''We don't want to impose on Iraq a cookie-cutter approach. That's not American foreign policy.'' But some secular-minded Iraqis criticized American diplomats for not working harder to block efforts by Shiite politicians, many of whom are clerics, to expand the reach of Islam. Mahmood Othman, a Kurdish legislator, said Kurdish leaders did not vigorously oppose Islamist language in part because American diplomats often did not object either. For instance, Mr. Othman said, American diplomats had acquiesced to the language that would clear the way for clerical adjudication of family and personal disputes. ''The Kurds thought, as long as the Americans don't object, why should we object?'' Mr. Othman said. ''It's American policy to show that it is not opposed to Islam.'' In his Idaho appearance, Mr. Bush said he was optimistic despite a prediction by the negotiator for the Sunni Muslim minority that the country would ''rise in the streets'' if the constitution, as currently written, is approved. ''You know, you're speaking about one voice,'' the president told a small group of reporters at the Tamarack resort near Donnelly, Idaho. ''There is more than one Sunni involved in the process. Reaching an accord on a constitution, after years of dictatorship, is not easy. And so you're seeing people express their opinion. '' The Sunnis, Mr. Bush added, ''have got to make a choice: do they want to live in a society that's free, or do they want to live in violence?'' Shiite and Kurdish leaders who drafted most of the document say they will try to find an agreement on language with the Sunnis, whose main objection is the demand by Shiite leaders for a large autonomous region in the south. Secular Iraqi leaders say there are three areas in the constitution that worry them. While they say the constitution would change nothing by itself, they worry about the language establishing Islam as the official religion of the state and as ''a primary source of legislation.'' The constitution then says there can be no law that contradicts the ''basic beliefs of Islam.'' Some Iraqis fear that the phrase is so broad as to allow Iraqi judges wide latitude in striking down secular legislation. Some said they had preferred a phrase saying that no law could contradict the ''agreed upon'' principles of Islam, which they say would have substantially narrowed the sort of legislation that could be struck down. In addition, some Iraqis are concerned about language that would allow experts in ''Shariah law'' to sit on the Iraqi Supreme Federal Court. Some worried that such experts would inevitably be clerics. The clause does not answer such crucial questions as how many such experts would sit on the court or how they would be appointed. Instead, it calls for a law to be written by a future elected body. As a safeguard against a possibly overweening majority, the constitution states that the law must be approved by a two-thirds majority. ''What this means is that, before we pass a law, we're going to have to run it past a Shariah law expert,'' said Wael Abdul Latif, a Shiite judge and member of the constitutional drafting committee. ''I'm upset. Very.'' The other section prompting worry is one that deals with ''personal law,'' governing affairs like marriage, divorce and inheritance. The new constitution declares that ''Iraqis are free to abide in their personal lives according to their religions, sects or beliefs.'' And it calls for a law to set up a system to deal with such matters. Many Iraqi leaders, including those who took part in the negotiations over that phrase, said the language would clear the way for the Assembly to set up religious courts to regulate such matters. Secular Iraqi leaders fear that the Iraqi law governing family relations that is currently on the books, passed in 1959, will be abolished, and that Shariah law will dominate the lives of ordinary Iraqis. ''It sounds like the civil law will be canceled,'' Dr. Kuzai said. ''We had the best family law in the Middle East. And we'll go back to the clerics.'' Some secular-minded Iraqis believe the constitution is less important than political battles to come. Adnan Pachachi, a former foreign minister, said that if secular Sunni and Shiite leaders bind together with the Kurds, they might, after the next election, constitute a majority of the Assembly. As such, they could successfully block the imposition of an Islamic state. ''Iraqis of all faiths, confessions and otherwise, are free to conduct family issues according to their beliefs.'' Some secular Iraqis fear that the draft constitution, as written, would allow for the creation of religious courts that could erode women's rights and even pave the way for an Islamic theocracy.

"NYT",1992,"United Kingdom","Sexual Behavior Levels Compared in Studies In Britain and France","The higher you are on Britain's social ladder, the more likely you are to have had more than one sexual partner in the past year. And in France young people are more likely to use condoms than their elders. These are among the findings of new studies of sexual activity in France and Britain. The researchers, who reported their findings in the current issue of the journal Nature, said their research was the first and most comprehensive large-scale examination of sexual behavior in the two countries. They said they hoped the work would help in efforts to prevent the spread of AIDS. Multiple Sexual Partners In each country, at least twice as many men as women reported having more than one sexual partner in the last year. In Britain the figures were almost 14 percent for men and just under 7 percent for women; among the French, the figures were 13.3 percent for men and 5.6 percent for women. In the British study, 6.1 percent of men reported having had a homosexual experience and 1.4 percent said they had had a homosexual partner in the last five years. The French researchers, who also reported on homosexuality among women, said 4.1 percent of men and 2.6 percent of women reported having had sexual relations with a person of the same sex. Only 1.1 percent of men and three-tenths of 1 percent of women reported having relations with a person of the same sex in the past year. The proportion was almost five times higher in Paris than in rural communities. ""The AIDS epidemic has focused our need to collect information on sexual attitudes and life styles in order to predict and prevent the spread of H.I.V.,"" Kaye Wellings, a sociologist at St. Mary's Hospital Medical School in London, said of the human immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. Ms. Wellings was one of four researchers who conducted the British study. The survey was led by Dr. Anne M. Johnson, an epidemiologist at University College, London. Interviewers questioned more than 18,000 men and women in person about their sexual behavior. The people, who ranged in age from 16 to 59, were randomly chosen from a list of every household in England, Scotland and Wales. Dr. Alfred Spira, director of Analysis of Sexual Behavior in France, a research consortium financed by the French Government, led the investigation there. More than 20,000 people from 18 to 69 were randomly selected from lists of households with telephones and interviewed by telephone. The French researchers found that more than 56 percent of men and 43.7 percent of women said they used a condom during intercourse at least once in the past year. The most widespread use of condoms was among 18- and 19-year-olds, with 79.8 percent of men reporting at least one condom use, as against 48 percent of women. Condom use was more prevalent in people with several partners. Among 18- to 44-year-olds, about 75 percent of homosexual men with multiple partners and more than 65 percent of women with multiple heterosexual partners used condoms at least once in the last year. ""The most surprising finding for me,"" Dr. Spira said in a telephone interview, ""was the relatively high use of condoms among young people, especially during their first experiences in intercourse, though it decreases as people become more accustomed to sex. There seems to have been a real increase in condom use in France, but unfortunately it is not enough because about one-third of men and half of women at risk of contracting H.I.V. or sexually transmitted diseases never used a condom during the last 12 months."" The findings should help public health officials calculate more precise estimates of the number of people likely to become infected with H.I.V. and to better direct prevention efforts, the scientists said. More than 18,000 cases of H.I.V. infection have been reported in Britain and about 25,000 cases in France. ""Our results clearly indicate that for prevention purposes you must carefully take into account demographics,"" Dr. Spira said. ""Sexual behavior is not the same among men and women, young and old."" In the French study, respondents were assured in a letter that all answers would remain anonymous and that information identifying them would be destroyed once the first answer was entered into a computer. The British relied on 500 experienced interviewers who met individually with the subjects. Findings in Britain Among the British findings were these: *The proportion of people reporting 10 or more partners so far in their lifetime is higher among people from 25 to 44 than among those over 45. *A quarter of men under 25 reported five or more partners in the last five years. *People in the professional and managerial classes were twice as likely as manual workers to report having two or more partners in the last year. *More than one in five men and one in four women with five or more heterosexual partners in the last five years reported having had a H.I.V. test. Rates of testing declined in those 45 and older. Among men with homosexual partners, the proportion rose to more than 4 of 10. ""It's good news that people in the highest risk groups seem to be getting the message about H.I.V. and have gone on to seek advice and testing,"" Dr. Johnson said. In the French survey, just over 3 percent of men reported intercourse with prostitutes over the last five years, with the practice much more frequent in Paris than in rural areas. The proportion of French men having their first intercourse with a prostitute has sharply decreased in the last 20 years. The figure was 10 percent for men now 45 to 69, compared with only 2 percent for those 20 to 24. Although the researchers said the level of condom use was higher than they had expected, they noted that a high proportion of people did not use condoms. The survey found that one-third of heterosexual men, half of the heterosexual women and one-quarter of men who were homosexual or bisexual did not use condoms. ""The level of protection currently used is insufficient to halt the spread of the H.I.V. epidemic,"" the French report said. The British survey also asked about condom use, but those results were not included in the initial report. The full results of both surveys are to be published next year. The scientists said they could not make direct comparisons between the studies until then, though Dr. Johnson said she was struck by the similarities. The British survey, which cost about $1.7 million and started in 1990, was financed by the Wellcome Trust, the country's biggest private supporter of biomedical research, after the Government of Margaret Thatcher, then the Prime Minister, refused to provide financial support. The French research, which is continuing, has cost at least $2.5 million so far. It is publicly financed.","The higher you are on 's social ladder, the more likely you are to have had more than one sexual partner in the past year.

The British survey also asked about condom use, but those results were not included in the initial report. The full results of both surveys are to be published next year. The scientists said they could not make direct comparisons between the studies until then, though Dr.  said she was struck by the similarities. The British survey, which cost about $1.7 million and started in 1990, was financed by the , the country's biggest private supporter of biomedical research, after the Government of , then the Prime Minister, refused to provide financial support. The French research, which is continuing, has cost at least $2.5 million so far. It is publicly financed."
"NYT",1988,"United Kingdom","STAGE VIEW; ENGLISHWOMEN MAKE AN IMPACT AS DIRECTORS","Women directors are in the ascendancy at Stratford this season. Last year, Deborah Warner made her Royal Shakespeare Company debut with her stunning production of ''Titus Andronicus'' (starring Brian Cox). That production has since moved to the small Pit theater in the company's London home, the Barbican. Ms. Warner, founder of the Kick Theater Company, has followed up that initial success with her Stratford production of ''King John,'' once again demonstrating her ability to vivify one of Shakespeare's lesser works. At the same time this season, Garry Hynes (an Irish director and a co-founder of the Druid Theater in Galway) has made her own Stratford debut with ''The Man of Mode,'' an acerbic Restoration comedy by George Etherege. Di Trevis, by comparison an R.S.C. veteran, offers as her seasonal contribution a mainstage production of ''Much Ado About Nothing.'' Ms. Trevis's exuberant revival of ''The Revenger's Tragedy'' recently completed its engagement in the Pit, where it ran along with Ms. Warner's ''Titus Andronicus.'' The three are on the crest of a wave of women directors. Sarah Pia Anderson also directs for the R.S.C. and Janice Honeyman has just staged Athol Fugard's ''Hello and Goodbye'' in a special R.S.C. collaboration with the Almeida Theater. This season two first-rank British actresses, Judi Dench and Geraldine McEwan, directed Shakespeare plays for Kenneth Branagh's Renaissance Theater, and other women are represented at various Fringe theaters. Of all the Englishwomen, Ms. Warner is the one who has made the greatest impact. As demonstrated by both ''Titus Andronicus'' and ''King John,'' she has a visceral sense of theatricality. In her hands, plays draw an immediate responsiveness from the audience. With ''Titus Andronicus'' and ''King John,'' we share the heat and lightning of the performance (and on a summer evening we also share the warmth in the hot-box environment of Stratford's Other Place Theater). ''Zeal'' is a prevalent word in Shakespeare's version of King John's reign (a history play that omits all mention of the Magna Carta). As played by Nicholas Woodeson, King John is zealous about improving his political advantage, even to having himself crowned twice, and the bastard Philip Faulconbridge, as played by David Morrissey, is hot-blooded and hotheaded. Usually considered a patriot, Faulconbridge becomes a zealot in this production, shifting his allegiance in order to remain on the firing line. Mr. Woodeson's performance in the title role is the fulcrum of the production. Napoleonic in stature, garbed in an oversize greatcoat, he looks like Maurice Sendak's storybook Max in battle dress when he is crowned king of the Wild Things. Like Max, Mr. Woodeson's sometimes childlike John is surrounded by a rumpus, which he controls by the force of his personality. At the same time, the king still reflects the will of his formidable mother (Cherry Morris) and he is antagonistic to Constance (Susan Engel), mother to his nephew and rival, Arthur (Lyndon Davis, who played Michael Gambon as a young man in television's ''Singing Detective''). As movingly portrayed by Ms. Engel, Constance has a firm dedication to purpose (installing her son on the throne in place of John). Ms. Engel exudes conviction. If the son had had half the driving ambition of his mother, he might have been able to supplant the king. In the background are two other women of authority, Faulconbridge's mother and a Spanish princess able to juggle loyalties to various warring sovereigns. Led by Constance, ''King John'' has more important roles for women than most other, more popular, Shakespearean plays. This may have been one of the attractions of the work for the director, but more than by anything else she seems fascinated by the intricate political canvas. Instead of battle scenes there are repeated peace negotiations. At the brink of war, there is always someone to offer a conciliatory solution, marital or martial. In this sense, the play wears its relevance like a coat of mail. We can see in the stalemated confrontations between England and France, between church and state, a reflection of our own times. Although nothing can completely disguise the contrivances of the play, the rough-hewn ''King John'' remains captivating, and the actors throw themselves into the fray, igniting the unadorned atmosphere with panoply and fervor. Ms. Warner has seemingly collected all the ladders in Stratford and neighboring communities for the production. They become a barricade as well as ramparts and, in one case, a treaty table. The only other prominent scenery is an assortment of hard-backed chairs, which leads one to regard this as a chairs-and-ladders production. Ms. Warner emphasizes the gamesmanship of the contest - ''King John'' as power play. She works so imaginatively in the tight confines of Stratford's Other Place and the Barbican's Pit that one wonders how she would approach a mainstage Shakespearean production. She would, one assumes, bring new energy to that environment. Ms. Trevis's mainstage ''Much Ado About Nothing'' is standard fare. It was just a few years ago that the R.S.C. offered a version with Derek Jacobi as Benedick and Sinead Cusack as Beatrice, and there would not seem to be a need for a new Stratford ''Much Ado'' so soon. But the play is a consistent crowd-pleaser, and the audience seems pleased with the broad antics of Clive Merrison and Maggie Steed, the B&B of this season. Mr. Merrison is a sour-tempered Benedick. Ms. Steed is more animated than her partner, but her strength is more that of a compulsive comedienne than a witty Beatrice. There is little sexual chemistry between these two lovers. They and the production are overshadowed by the Kevin Kline-Blythe Danner version recently in Central Park. There are stalwart performances, however, by David Lyon and Ralph Fiennes as Don Pedro and Claudio, and a mirthful one by David Waller as Dogberry. Ms. Trevis has unconvincingly transported the play to 20th-century Italy, where militiamen of vaguely World War I variety drop out of the sky. This is one Shakespeare play that rarely benefits from transplantation. For a clearer view of Ms. Trevis's directorial capabilities, there was Cyril Tourneur's ''Revenger's Tragedy,'' which moved to the Pit from Stratford. Spearheaded by the galvanic performance of Antony Sher in the title role, counterpointed by Nicholas Farrell as the revenger's chief foe, ''The Revenger's Tragedy'' filled the small R.S.C. theaters with blind retribution and black humor. Sharing the mainstage with ''Much Ado'' are a revival of Adrian Noble's ''Macbeth'' and Nicholas Hytner's new production of ''The Tempest.'' I saw ''The Tempest'' at a preview. The opening had been delayed because of an injury to John Wood. Returning to England's classical theater after an absence of 10 years, the actor is a commanding Prospero; Duncan Bell is a haunting Ariel. But the production lacks the requisite sense of magic. The play is precariously aligned on a steeply raked stage, and the minimal scenery and sudden shifts in lighting do little to enhance the mood. Deep within, there may be an attempt to reduce the play to essentials, to create a kind of Samuel Beckett ''Endgame'' out of Prospero's plight. If so, such a concept is unfulfilled. The production is marked by its lassitude. The other noteworthy event at Stratford, in addition to ''King John'' is ''The Man of Mode,'' a malicious comedy about style and sexism. The play is a challenging choice for Ms. Hynes, but Etherege's theme does allow for commentary from all corners, and she has given the play an ecumenical reading, with each character receiving his or her comeuppance. The title character, Sir Fopling Flutter, does not appear until the play is well in progress, but his spirit - luxuriously exemplified by the actor Simon Russell Beale - is infectious. Sir Fopling, an oafish Englishman turned Paris dandy, makes a case for ''mode'' (what today might be called attitude), one that is expressed in alternative fashion by the play's anti-hero, Dorimant (Miles Anderson). Dorimant is a duplicitous seducer devoted to the art of the chase and unchastened by the selfishness of his escapades. The character finally suffers his fate (marriage) at the hands of an heiress (Amanda Root) who will not settle for morality a la mode. In the role, Ms. Root is a clear-eyed and determined challenger, and Mr. Anderson's Dorimant is, to a great extent, her victim. In Ms. Hynes's otherwise exemplary production, there is one instance of miscasting and there is a dubious scenic choice. Holes are torn in the walls, ostensibly to symbolize the fact that the society is so devoted to gossip and voyeurism. The result is that the set simply looks in need of refurbishing. Ms. Hynes's command of the comedy is stylish, and, like Ms. Warner's contribution, unaffected. There are no intrusive anachronisms, but there are contemporary parallels for us to draw. ''The Man of Mode'' shares the Elizabethan-style Swan Theater with ''The Plain Dealer'' by William Wycherley and ''The Constant Couple'' by George Farquhar. Scheduling did not permit me to see the Farquhar or Robert Holman's ''Across Oka'' (directed by Sarah Pia Anderson). But I did see the Wycherley, which, in spite of Ron Daniels's intelligent production, is not equal to the author's ''Country Wife'' or Etherege's ''Man of Mode.'' The play is about plain-dealing and plain-speaking, and its subtext deals with legal pettifoggery. The voluble protagonist of the implausible narrative is Captain Manly, who is principled to the point of being priggish. The women are more evocative, especially the character of Olivia (Joanne Pearce), who amusingly plays Manly for a fool. One of the oddest characters is the relentlessly litigious Widow Blackacre, who never stops suing and never stops instructing her adult son about worldly dangers, warning him against visiting ''tennis courts and bawdy houses.'' In this ''slandering age,'' words are mighty weapons and one randy old codger tries to rape the widow with a verse. Along with Adrian Noble and Bill Alexander, Mr. Daniels is one of the R.S.C.'s most creative male directors, but, increasingly, women are assuming a greater artistic responsibility within the company. Deborah Warner, Garry Hynes and Di Trevis are prodigious directorial discoveries, clearly able to handle the most difficult of classical material.","Women directors are in the ascendancy at  this season.

"NYT",2012,"United Kingdom","Success at Open Bodes Well for Britons' Chances at Wimbledon","Whatever happens from here on out at the United States Open, the tennis summer of 2012 shall in no small part be remembered for compelling evidence of a country's climate change. Those dark clouds of defeatism that hovered for decades over the famed Wimbledon lawns and British tennis have finally rolled out and been replaced by a sky of gold and silver hue and hope. Andy Murray's thrashing of Roger Federer in the Olympic final after losing to him in the Wimbledon final has seemingly put Murray, 25, on the verge of winning a Grand Slam tournament. Meanwhile, 18-year-old Laura Robson's rollout in New York has elevated the British notion of His and Her Wimbledon titles from pure fantasy to comprehendible possibility. ''That would be a truly great thing, the ultimate,'' said Leon Smith, who directs men's and women's tennis for the Lawn Tennis Association and captains Britain's Davis Cup team. After watching a British junior, Luke Bambridge, fall in straight sets to an American, Harrison Adams, on a side court early Sunday afternoon, Smith took a seat at Louis Armstrong Stadium for Robson's match against the defending champion, Samantha Stosur of Australia. It was another defeat, but one in which Robson -- a crowd favorite and perhaps a budding star -- saved eight match points and had Stosur sweating out a 6-4, 6-4 fourth-round victory. Having struggled with grand expectations as a potential savior of British women's tennis, Robson was already a rousing success this summer. She won a silver medal at the Olympics in mixed doubles with Murray and had consecutive upsets last week of the past Grand Slam champions Kim Clijsters and Li Na. There was a connection, in Smith's opinion, a bridge between London and New York. Not only did Robson team with Murray at the Olympics, she was chosen by him over 20-year-old Heather Watson, who had the higher ranking. Murray's reasoning was based on Robson's size, 5 feet 11 inches, and her left-handed serve and forehand. ''You can just see that it's given her a lot of confidence,'' Smith said, and the packed crowd at Armstrong received more than a sampling of Robson's game and grit. Had she capitalized on break-point chances in both sets with looks at second serves, she might have found herself in the quarterfinals. Still, this was just an introduction. ''She's going to be at the top of the women's game,'' Smith said. His hiring by the Lawn Tennis Association almost three years ago was, in effect, an attempt to sprinkle the Murray stardust over the rest of Britain's long-suffering program. Smith coached Murray as a youngster in Scotland, so it was no coincidence that he hired Judy Murray, Andy's mother, as Britain's Fed Cup captain. Though Smith insisted that Murray ''is too good not to win'' a Grand Slam title, he said the Olympic breakthrough had already made him the motivational figure that Britain has been waiting for. ''It's not just his world standing but the way he's transformed his body over the last four or five years,'' Smith said. The message to Robson being: if quickness and footwork are her greatest challenges, something can be done about if she puts in the work. And if a body can be transformed, so can the fatalism that had long ago attached itself to Britain's ability to produce -- first and foremost -- a Wimbledon champion. ''I think already Laura is in much better shape than she was,'' said Virginia Wade -- the name Robson should get used to hearing if she uses this summer's results as a springboard from her current ranking of 89. Wade was the last British woman to win Wimbledon, in 1977. As for Murray, even should he prevail in New York, he will next summer again confront the pressure of producing the first British Wimbledon men's champion since Fred Perry in 1936. Wade, for her part, has no interest in the preservation of her distinction for as long as Perry's. But as the years have passed, she knows, as a BBC broadcaster, the suffering has become much worse for young British players than for her having to watch them fail. ''We've had good junior players, but the problem has been making the jump to the senior level,'' Wade said. ''The record has been so bad that you start to feel like it's become a war you can't win. If you don't know what the experience of winning feels like, you start to say: If only I wasn't injured. If only the wind wasn't blowing against me.'' Britain's standard excuses have been related to the rainy climate that curtails the sport's outdoor recreational appeal and Wimbledon's grass courts that are part of tennis lore but are not the ideal developmental surface. That is why Robson's success on the Flushing Meadows hard courts could be the impetus that drives her to join Murray in a more permanent partnership of regular contention. ''When you're 18 and on a high like she's been on here, it's inevitable that you come down,'' Wade said. ''You plateau and then you go up again.'' Robson's story is just beginning to be told, so there is no way of knowing if she can get to where Murray has gone, or how high is up. But here is the biggest news break so far of the long tennis summer: the sky over Wimbledon is no longer falling.","Whatever happens from here on out at the  Open, the tennis summer of 2012 shall in no small part be remembered for compelling evidence of a country's climate change.

"NYT",2014,"Afghanistan","Taliban and Government Imperil Gains for Afghan Women, Advocates Say","KABUL, Afghanistan -- Advocates say that women's rights and security in Afghanistan are under mounting assault from all sides -- the Taliban insurgency and the government alike -- putting at risk 12 years of hard-won gains for women here. The country's Parliament is about to approve legislation that would strip away crucial legal protections. The insurgents have mounted a string of violent attacks on female officials. And advocates for women are deeply worried by the news that President Hamid Karzai has been negotiating secretly with the Taliban, who enforced hard-line, fundamentalist restrictions on women during their years in power. And the advocates see two potential disasters looming for Afghan women this year. One would be the failure to complete a long-term security agreement with the United States, which could lead to the departure of American and other international forces and aid agencies, by far the strongest proponents for women here. The other is the election in April to choose Mr. Karzai's successor. The slates of many of the 11 candidates for president are dominated by warlords and fundamentalists who share the Taliban's view that women should never be allowed out of their homes. ''Women are not on the agenda now,'' said Huma Safi, an activist with Equality for Peace and Democracy, an advocacy group. ''Every time we turn around, they're passing another law against women.'' The killings of four female police officers since July and the abductions of and assassination attempts against female members of Parliament and their families in Ghazni Province last year have aroused concerns that the Taliban are singling out women for violence and intimidation, though all government officials, male or female, can expect to become targets. The moves in Parliament, on the other hand, seem like attacks from out of nowhere, advocates say, with the potential to do much broader harm. One of the proposed laws would have repealed a requirement that one-quarter of the seats on provincial councils be reserved for women. After intense lobbying, activists managed to get the bill amended to partly preserve the quota, at 20 percent instead of 25; it has been passed and now awaits the president's signature. ''The sworn enemies of women almost got the quota eliminated,'' said Soraya Sobhrang, the representative for women on the national Human Rights Commission. They ''have the power to pave the way for whatever law they want.'' Another proposal would make it easier for a father to arrange child marriages, giving fathers guardianship rights over children that trump those of mothers and the courts. A third would prohibit the nation's courts from hearing testimony of one family member against another, a rule that would make it almost impossible to prosecute domestic violence and abuse cases. Both measures are seen as likely to pass, though the president could refuse to sign them. Manizha Naderi, the head of Women for Afghan Women, a group that runs a network of shelters and counseling centers for abused women and children, said the law on testimony ''virtually provides impunity'' to abusers within the family. Women at the shelters that her group and others run ''include victims whose in-laws, husbands, fathers and sons have broken their arms and legs, chopped off lips, tongues and noses, pulled out fingernails, sold them, stabbed them and left them for dead,'' Ms. Naderi said. The proposed law would prohibit even the victims in cases like those from testifying. In the section on Afghanistan in its worldwide report for 2013, Human Rights Watch said, ''With international interest in Afghanistan rapidly waning, opponents of women's rights seized the opportunity to begin rolling back the progress made since the end of Taliban rule.'' One of the biggest supporters of the bills is a member of Parliament from Herat, Qazi Nazir Ahmad Hanafi, who derides female activists as women of low morals who are un-Islamic. ''Those who are against these laws are people who own shelters, which are run like brothels,'' Mr. Hanafi said. ''These women have not helped women in Afghanistan, they have destroyed families.'' ''This is an Islamic country and women will be treated and respected in accordance with the guidance of Islam, not some communist, secular conspiracy,'' Mr. Hanafi said. Ms. Naderi said she was anxious over Mr. Karzai's pursuit of a deal with the insurgents. ''If the Taliban come back, they're going to come back with a vengeance, and they'll take it out on the women,'' Ms. Naderi said. With 28 facilities helping abused women and children in 10 provinces, Women for Afghan Women would be especially vulnerable, she said, ''Our staff will be the first on the Taliban's list to set an example for others.'' Other activists were not quite that alarmed, at least not yet. ''We are worried, but we are not without hope,'' said Hasina Safi, head of the Afghan Women's Network, an umbrella group of activist organizations. ''We are much bigger in our numbers now, we have established networks, and we are not as isolated as we were in the Taliban time.'' Activists from the women's network and other groups have held a round of meetings with Western embassies over the past three weeks, and they received what Ms. Safi said were oral assurances that financial assistance to Afghan women's groups would not be cut; nearly all such groups depend on money from international donors. In all, more than $100 million a year in aid to Afghanistan is earmarked for women's issues, the United Nations estimates. Ms. Safi said the absence of women from Mr. Karzai's talks with the Taliban was a major concern. There are women on the country's High Peace Council, but Ms. Safi said they had been paid little heed, and the council itself is not closely involved in the talks. Nader Nadery, director of the Afghanistan Research and Evaluation Unit, said women had gained political strength by building alliances. ''Afghan women's groups have moved from being individual voices,'' Mr. Nadery said. ''They are now a very powerful collective voice, if not a full-fledged movement, and it will be difficult for any politician to ignore them completely.'' Ms. Sobhrang, the representative on the Human Rights Commission, said 30 activists had drafted a charter on women's rights that they plan to debate at a larger forum of female activists next week, and then use to assess candidates in the election, predicting that they would endorse one or two. That could make an impact in the crowded field. At least one-third of registered Afghan voters are women, and their advocacy groups tend to have more money and organizing experience than many of the inexperienced presidential campaigns. Ms. Sobhrang called the gains women have made since the ouster of Taliban rule in 2002 ''fragile but reversible,'' a phrase often used by American military leaders in a broader context. ''We still haven't brought fundamental change to the lives of women in Afghanistan,'' she said. Four weeks ago, the country got its first female police chief, Col. Jamila Bayaz, who was given command of the sprawling District 1 headquarters in Kabul. Colonel Bayaz, who is one of 2,000 women who have joined or rejoined the police force since 2002, said she was aware of the concerns about retaining the gains women have made. She began her career 32 years ago, when women were as numerous in the police force as they are now, an accomplishment interrupted by civil war and the ascent of the Taliban. She does not think that will happen again. ''I'm sure our international friends will not abandon us,'' the colonel said.",",  -- Advocates say that women's rights and security in  are under mounting assault from all sides -- the  insurgency and the government alike -- putting at risk 12 years of hard-won gains for women here. The country's  is about to approve legislation that would strip away crucial legal protections. The insurgents have mounted a string of violent attacks on female officials. And advocates for women are deeply worried by the news that President Hamid  has been negotiating secretly with the , who enforced hard-line, fundamentalist restrictions on women during their years in power. And the advocates see two potential disasters looming for  women this year. One would be the failure to complete a long-term security agreement with the , which could lead to the departure of American and other international forces and aid agencies, by far the strongest proponents for women here. The other is the election in April to choose Mr. 's successor. The slates of many of the 11 candidates for president are dominated by warlords and fundamentalists who share the 's view that women should never be allowed out of their homes. ''Women are not on the agenda now,'' said , an activist with , an advocacy group. ''Every time we turn around, they're passing another law against women.'' The killings of four female police officers since July and the abductions of and assassination attempts against female members of  and their families in  last year have aroused concerns that the  are singling out women for violence and intimidation, though all government officials, male or female, can expect to become targets. The moves in , on the other hand, seem like attacks from out of nowhere, advocates say, with the potential to do much broader harm. One of the proposed laws would have repealed a requirement that one-quarter of the seats on provincial councils be reserved for women. After intense lobbying, activists managed to get the bill amended to partly preserve the quota, at 20 percent instead of 25; it has been passed and now awaits the president's signature. ''The sworn enemies of women almost got the quota eliminated,'' said , the representative for women on the national . They ''have the power to pave the way for whatever law they want.'' Another proposal would make it easier for a father to arrange child marriages, giving fathers guardianship rights over children that trump those of mothers and the courts. A third would prohibit the nation's courts from hearing testimony of one family member against another, a rule that would make it almost impossible to prosecute domestic violence and abuse cases. Both measures are seen as likely to pass, though the president could refuse to sign them. Manizha , the head of Women for  Women, a group that runs a network of shelters and counseling centers for abused women and children, said the law on testimony ''virtually provides impunity'' to abusers within the family. Women at the shelters that her group and others run ''include victims whose in-laws, husbands, fathers and sons have broken their arms and legs, chopped off lips, tongues and noses, pulled out fingernails, sold them, stabbed them and left them for dead,'' Ms.  said. The proposed law would prohibit even the victims in cases like those from testifying. In the section on  in its worldwide report for 2013,  said, ''With international interest in  rapidly waning, opponents of women's rights seized the opportunity to begin rolling back the progress made since the end of  rule.'' One of the biggest supporters of the bills is a member of  from , Qazi Nazir Ahmad , who derides female activists as women of low morals who are un-Islamic. ''Those who are against these laws are people who own shelters, which are run like brothels,'' Mr.  said. ''These women have not helped women in , they have destroyed families.''

"NYT",1993,"Australia","Technology; The Tools of a New Art Form","When the photographer Rick Smolan decided to create a multimedia version of ""From Alice to Ocean,"" his coffee-table book about a young woman's walk across the Australian desert with four camels, he had rich material to work with: his own photographs and narration by the woman, Robyn Davidson, reading from her own best seller on the trip, ""Tracks."" To these Mr. Smolan added short video clips on Australian cultures, animal life and his photographic techniques. The challenge was to put it all together in an interactive form that could be viewed on a personal computer with a CD-ROM player and allow the user either to sit back and let the story unfold or use a mouse to select annotated side trips, like a photo essay on life in an aboriginal village. Mr. Smolan said the project may not have been possible without a software tool called Director, produced by Macromedia, a San Francisco company whose multimedia development software has become a de facto standard. Director enables multimedia producers to link text, video, graphics, animation and sound, without writing the many lines of software code that such an undertaking might otherwise require. ""When we put the interactive CD together it gave us an incredible feeling of freedom, because we were able to give people many different paths through the story,"" said Mr. Smolan, whose project team included a techie adept at using Director. Since its CD-ROM release last year by the publishers Addison-Wesley and Against All Odds Productions, which are giving the software away with the $50 coffee-table book, the CD-ROM version of ""From Alice to Ocean,"" has come to be considered the state of the art in multimedia. Apple Computer Inc., which subsidized Mr. Smolan's project, is also giving away a copy of ""Alice"" to help sell its $499 CD-ROM players -- machines that run compact disks containing data, graphics, text or music. In a field where 3,000 copies constitute a best seller, would-be creators of multimedia titles soon run into two harsh realities. First, to create anything of professional quality can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. Mr. Smolan and Apple will not discuss their costs, but people in the industry guess that as much as $1 million might have gone into ""Alice."" Second, multimedia creators not only must be proficient writers, musicians and film directors, they must also learn how to write software code that instructs a photo at precisely what point in a musical score to appear on screen or tells the video clip when to give way to the text. Or they can use tools like Macromedia's Director to perform much of this software drudgery for them. Macromedia, created over the course of 1991 and 1992 through the merger of three companies that were founded in the 80's, is the largest supplier of multimedia development tools. And though still hardly a household word, Macromedia makes the tools that have been used in the creation of virtually every best-selling multimedia title. Besides ""From Alice to Ocean,"" some of the popular CD-ROM titles include ""The Journeyman Project,"" by Presto Studios, an interactive science fiction game/novel, which combines animation, video with real actors and photo-realistic three-dimensional worlds. Macromedia software has also been used to create employee training programs by businesses like McGraw Hill and Prentice Hall, and presentations by prominent companies including American Airlines, A.T.& T. and Kellogg's. And while Hollywood still relies on hardware and software from Silicon Graphics Inc. for much of its special effects, Macromedia tools have been used in creating sequences in ""Jurassic Park,"" ""The Firm"" and other films. Success has been slow in coming, and none of Macromedia's predecessor companies -- Macromind, Authorware and Paracomp -- ever made any money. But Macromedia has begun to take off, thanks to the rapid growth of the market for CD-ROM players and for CD-ROM multimedia titles. Sales of personal computers equipped with a CD-ROM drive, 2 million in 1992, are expected to reach 15 million a year by 1995, according to Dataquest, a Silicon Valley market research firm. Executives for privately held Macromedia, which does not disclose its financial data, say the company has been profitable the last four quarters. And analysts estimate that Macromedia had 1992 revenues of about $30 million -- or more than one-third of the estimated $80 million market for multimedia software tools. The company thus seems well positioned to benefit from the multimedia mania sweeping the computing, communications and entertainment industries. ""IN 1994, we're going to see the company take off,"" said Charles Finnie, an analyst with Volpe, Welty & Company, a venture capital and investment banking firm, which has invested in Macromedia. ""There are a lot of people out there trying to develop new multimedia titles."" Many analysts expect Macromedia to make an initial public offering of stock by the end of the year, but the company's management, citing legal restraints, declined to confirm or deny that prediction. With more than 100,000 users, Director has become the young multimedia industry's lingua franca. ""We like to let our animators choose their own tools, but having said that, every animator we've ever worked with chose Director,"" said Stuart Gannes, chief executive of the Books that Work Corporation, a Palo Alto-based startup company that produces interactive how-to books on CD-ROM. ""The alternative was to build our own tools from scratch,"" he said, ""and we don't want to build tools, we want to make titles."" So far, Director is only available to run on the Macintosh, but a program called Player is available, which allows titles created on the Macintosh to run on personal computers using the Microsoft Corporation's Windows operating system. And a Windows version of Director is due next year. A separate Player program allows Director titles to run on Silicon Graphics work stations. ""THERE'S so much hype about multimedia out there,"" said John C. (Bud) Colligan, Macromedia's president and chief executive. ""But we are delivering real tools, and customers are using our tools to make real products."" But some analysts say it is not certain that Macromedia can continue to hold the lion's share of CD-ROM tool sales. The company's delay in delivering a Windows version of Director has allowed several small companies to fill the void. Aimtech, for example, offers Icon Author for use with Windows, and Asymetrix, which is owned by Microsoft's co-founder, Paul Allen, sells Toolbook. Meanwhile, Microsoft itself has introduced a multimedia tool, and Apple has recently introduced its own multimedia software tool for use with various computer makers' hardware. ""They continue to have a dominant share of certain kinds of titles on the Apple Macintosh,"" Mark Stahlman, a consultant, said of Macromedia. ""But the Mac has lost its leading role in multimedia,"" said Mr. Stahlman, president of New Media Associates, a New York-based consulting firm. ""Silicon Graphics has stolen the high end, and Windows has come in from below,"" he said. ""I wouldn't say these guys are in the best position."" But in hopes of broadening the multimedia production business, Macromedia offers products beyond Director. For the corporate market, for example, where users employ multimedia for training and sales presentations, Macromedia sells a program called Authorware. Authorware uses a flow-chart motif, which is more familiar to business people than the artistic storyboards in Director. Authorware ""is immediately approachable by complete novices,"" said Jack Wright, manager of Honeywell Inc.'s multimedia center in Phoenix. ""I'm not a programmer and most of our people are not,"" he said. ""But the learning curve is so short I can have people producing in this environment in two days.""","When the photographer  decided to create a multimedia version of ""From  to ,"" his coffee-table book about a young woman's walk across the Australian desert with four camels, he had rich material to work with: his own photographs and narration by the woman, , reading from her own best seller on the trip, ""Tracks.""

"NYT",2009,"France","Ted Lapidus, 79, Designer; Reshaped French Fashion","Ted Lapidus, the designer who shook up French fashion in the 1960s and '70s with the safari suit, military jackets for women and ready-to-wear unisex clothing, died Monday in Cannes, France. He was 79. His sister, the fashion designer Rose Torrente-Mett, said the cause was respiratory failure after he suffered from leukemia for several years, Agence France-Presse reported. What Francois Truffaut was to film, Mr. Lapidus was at least for a time to French haute couture. Determinedly modern, he translated the design vocabulary of haute couture into sleek, affordable clothes aimed at French consumers barely in their 20s. ''In France now, the daughters are clothing the mothers and the sons the fathers,'' he said in a 1964 interview when introducing his ready-to-wear line at Macy's. Mr. Lapidus sensed a generational shift in France and capitalized on it; his clothes found favor with style-setters like Brigitte Bardot, Alain Delon, Jean-Paul Belmondo and Jane Fonda. Edmond Lapidus, who later adopted the American-sounding Ted, was born in Paris, where his father, a Russian immigrant, worked as a tailor. Unable to afford medical school, he took up the family trade. While attending a technical school in Tokyo, he saw the possibility of applying high fashion fabricating techniques to industrial production. ''If you have the right work force, there's no reason why this cannot be done in a factory just as well as in a fashion house,'' he said. After an apprenticeship with Dior, he started his own fashion house in 1951. In 1958 he opened the Ted Lapidus boutique on the Rue Marbeuf. In 1963, he created a near scandal in the world of haute couture by forming a partnership with the manufacturer Belle Jardiniere, which mass-produced his designs and sold them at its 250 budget-priced stores in France. Regardless, that year he was admitted to the official French couture association. ''He was one of the first to do boutiques, along with Yves Saint Laurent,'' said George Simonton, an assistant professor of fashion design at the Fashion Institute of Technology. ''They became so popular that they spread to the United States.'' Mr. Lapidus's first boutique in New York opened across from Bloomingdale's in 1974. It was followed a year later by a store on Fifth Avenue at 53rd Street. ''His clothes really fit,'' Mr. Simonton said. ''Even people without good bodies looked good in them because they were so well tailored. He was a pioneer in making the denim category sexy by putting some style and fit into it.'' Mr. Lapidus may be best remembered for a sand-colored safari jacket with leather lacing in the front, worn by Ms. Bardot, and for a military-style jacket with epaulets and gold buttons, both produced for the mass market. In the 1970s Mr. Lapidus turned his energies to franchising his boutiques and licensing his name for perfumes, jewelry, watches and sunglasses. In 1989 his son, Olivier, became design director of the company, which was sold to a succession of owners."," , the designer who shook up French fashion in the 1960s and '70s with the safari suit, military jackets for women and ready-to-wear unisex clothing, died Monday in , .

"NYT",1994,"Canada","THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; Flawed Study Raises Questions on U.S. Research","Reports that a Canadian researcher falsified data in a major breast cancer study and that leaders of the study and Federal health officials delayed disclosing the situation are raising serious questions about the quality of medical research, the honesty of medical researchers and the various ways studies are done. The investigation also raises issues of medical and academic politics, such as how soon medical practice should be changed by results of experimental studies. Many practitioners prefer to wait for additional experience after initial reports in medical journals because they are aware that scientists are often under pressure to include enough patients to meet their quotas and face a need to publish to continue to get grants. And they remember that results of some studies turned out to be flawed. Then there is the growing criticism of the peer review system that editors of journals use to screen manuscripts for publication. There is a widespread misconception that scientific journals examine the raw research data. They do not. They evaluate the summaries of filtered data, which can make it difficult, if not impossible, to detect fabrications. Even the centers that coordinate large studies involving many hospitals deal primarily with derivative data. The coordinating centers often do not get original documents, except when they conduct random audits or when suspicions are raised about the nature of a scientist's research. The flawed breast cancer study was coordinated at the University of Pittsburgh by Dr. Bernard Fisher, a respected surgeon and senior cancer researcher who was a pioneer in developing some of the standard treatments for the disease. The study involved 5,000 doctors at 484 additional academic centers and community hospitals in the United States and Canada. The studies have been continuing for more than two decades and have cost taxpayers tens of millions of dollars. The United States Government has taken steps to be repaid $1 million from St. Luc's Hospital, a small community hospital in Montreal, where Federal officials say the principal investigator, Dr. Roger Poisson, falsified data on more than 100 of the 1,511 patients he enrolled in his part of 22 studies from 1975 to 1991. A Federal investigation found that Dr. Poisson had falsified data in his part of a study that helped change the way breast cancer is treated. That influential study concluded that full mastectomies were not necessary to prevent the spread of early forms of the disease in many women. While insisting that he did little more than tell ""white lies"" that he believed would not change the conclusions of the study, Dr. Poisson signed an agreement with the Federal Food and Drug Administration acknowledging that he had falsified results of other studies. Yet the reply that Dr. Poisson made to accusations from the Federal officials who investigated his role was rambling and disorganized. His reply creates the impression of an emotionally charged researcher who deliberately ignored what he saw as trivial rules of the study more than a dispassionate scientist who strove for objectivity and precision. Dr. Poisson's lawyer, William Brock of Montreal, said in an interview that ""at no time did he receive any personal benefit -- that was not his motivation."" But being a principal investigator in an important study involving a major public health problem can be a mark of distinction, even if it does not lead to financial gain. In a written reply to the United States Public Health Service's Office of Research Integrity, which spearheaded the Federal investigation, he stated: ""I always feel sorry for a nice case to be denied the right to enter a good protocol just on account of trivial details: a difference of a few days in the date of surgery because the patient took a long time to decide."" ""When I lost a patient who did not wish to participate,"" he said, ""I always took it as a personal defeat, knowing that the best protocol with the best biostatisticians is useless unless enough patients are registered,"" he said. He described the pressures he felt in asking a patient to participate in the study. ""People who are not on the front line of the battle have no idea how frustrating it can be to prepare an eligible patient for the trial, with several pep talks and a great deal of discussion, explanation for the informed consent and to convince the patient to participate and -- at the last moment -- to realize that the patient"" is ineligible for what he perceived to be a technicality, Dr. Poisson said. ""It is a feeling of letdown and of frustration."" Dr. Poisson also wrote: ""In several ways, I have been the victim of my own success. Was I dishonest? How many times have I heard, 'Dr. Poisson, I came to consult you because you have been highly recommended to me. I heard from several sources that you don't operate without good reason or remove a breast needlessly. My other surgeon wanted to do a radical mastectomy on me. What do you think?' "" Dr. Poisson said he should have read the fine print of the study design more carefully to avoid the irregularities. He said: ""Why would someone in my position knowingly take such enormous risks with so few precautions, if I had realized that I was committing such a crime? Had it been intentional, I would surely have been much more circumspect, and used a professional, or certainly a more skilled, well-coached and sophisticated staff."" Detection of the falsifications in the breast cancer surgery study seems to have grown out of a fluke observation. The Office of Research Integrity report said that in June 1990 staff members in Pittsburgh found in their files two reports of a breast cancer operation for one patient at St. Luc's Hospital. The patients appeared to be identical, except that they had different dates of surgery, and the discrepancy determined whether they were eligible for the study. Federal officials then conducted four audits that involved increasingly larger samples in which the investigators found from 5 to 10 percent of the patient cases had data irregularities. Among the findings were that in 13 of 20 cases, the informed consent documents were signed after the date the patients were enrolled and the treatment assigned by lot. So they then reviewed the records of all 1,511 cases enrolled by St. Luc's and all written in French. The investigators found repeated violations of the scientific guidelines that governed the way the study was carried out. Copies of correspondence that have not been publicly released show how concerned Federal officials were more than a year ago about the potential political repercussions from criticism of the flawed study. An official of the National Cancer Institute wrote to Dr. Fisher on Jan. 7, 1993, urging him to review the audit procedures and method of case selection for review. Among the cancer institute's concerns was that the data irregularities ""went undetected for more than a decade."" Another concern was the relatively small number of cases that Dr. Fisher's team selected for re-audit, a factor that the cancer institute suggested had contributed to the study group's ""inability to detect problems."" On Jan. 5, 1993, the National Cancer Institute wrote to Dr. Fisher urging him to publish soon and said that the The Journal of the National Cancer Institute was willing to expedite the review process of the paper. In an article in 1991, Dr. Fisher criticized doctors for enrolling fewer than 4 percent of breast cancer patients in clinical trials, saying that the low figure ""hardly indicates adequate use of a process that not only promotes superior patient care but also provides physicians with the opportunity to evaluate therapies potentially more effective than those being used."" The statement represented a complete turnaround for Dr. Fisher, who started out as a surgeon and laboratory researcher. ""I had no interest in chemotherapy, clinical trials or breast cancer,"" he wrote in last December's issue of The Journal of Clinical Oncology. But with time he became convinced of their value. Yet, he wrote, ""for two decades physicians had to be begged and cajoled to participate in trials."" By nature, many doctors are therapeutically conservative. The reasons are many and complicated. But, said Dr. Judith P. Swazey, the president of the Acadia Institute in Bar Harbor, Me., an expert in the ethics of clinical trials, ""when cases like this come out, it justifies one explanation for their therapeutic conservatism, that games do go on in research."" She also said: ""There is understandable reluctance the minute something comes out of any journal to say we are going to change our practice; and I find that understandable, particularly because most large clinical trials are not replicated. We are repeatedly told that science has a built-in correcting mechanism because studies are replicated. But that is less and less true."" Unless someone examines the raw data, problems can go undetected, she said. Dr. Poisson wrote that he realized that ""there is no excuse to cut the corners"" and that ""in the strict sense, I did bend the rules."" But he also said that he ""did not consider white lies for the purpose of practical logistics as a breach of my honor.""

"NYT",1994,"Canada","THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; Scientist Ousted From Cancer Study Declines to Testify to House Panel","In a surprising development, Dr. Bernard Fisher, the University of Pittsburgh scientist who for more than three decades directed a group of studies that helped change the way breast cancer is treated, will not appear before a Congressional subcommittee on Wednesday. Dr. Fisher was expected to address questions about delays in detecting and reporting falsified data that were used in his studies, which showed that lumpectomy was as effective as removing the entire breast for preventing recurrence in many women with early cancer. Two weeks ago, Federal officials at the National Cancer Institute, which has paid for Dr. Fisher's studies since 1958, ordered his removal as team leader for failing to adhere to his own guidelines. Dr. Fisher had repeatedly declined requests for interviews over the last few weeks, saying he would save his account for the Congressional hearing, to be conducted by Representative John D. Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. But a lawyer for the University of Pittsburgh asked the committee to excuse the 75-year-old Dr. Fisher from appearing because of his age, and the distress and physical strain of testifying. The lawyer, Martin Michaelson, of the Washington firm of Hogan & Hartson, said Dr. Fisher had cooperated fully with all requests from the committee and the National Cancer Institute. A staff member said the committee had excused Dr. Fisher for now but might call him in the future. The committee has not yet released the names of those who will be appearing. Among the many questions the committee will try to answer are these: *Is cheating in clinical trials as rare as scientists have maintained? *How did a scientist with as unsophisticated a view of the scientific method as Dr. Roger Poisson, of St. Luc Hospital in Montreal, come to be a principal investigator and major contributor in studies of such importance to public health? In a news conference at which he admitted that he had falsified data, Dr. Poisson seemed to have no understanding of the scientific method required in clinical trials. He justified his actions by saying that out of devotion for his patients he had tried to qualify them for state-of-the-art treatment. Dr. Dwight Kaufman, an official of the National Cancer Institute in Bethesda, Md., called Dr. Poisson's explanation ""farcical."" *How did leading cancer experts fail to detect such flaws in approving Dr. Poisson's participation in the standard peer review process? *What criteria are used to select principal investigators at hospitals that participate in large cooperative studies, and what training do they receive in the methods of conducting scientifically sound trials? *Why did the National Cancer Institute wait until December 1992 to require independent monitoring boards for studies conducted under its auspices, 13 years after the National Institutes of Health made such a recommendation? Such boards, which monitor data and safety, are customary in many federally sponsored studies, including those of heart disease. Dr. Fisher's studies did not include one. Dr. Kaufman said in an interview over the weekend that no one at his institute seemed to know about the 1979 recommendation. *Why did Dr. Fisher continue to submit papers containing contaminated St. Luc data to scientific journals without telling the editors about the problem and despite warnings not to do so from Federal officials after they learned about the problem? Federal officials and Dr. Fisher are now writing to the editors of these journals, and Dr. Fisher is withdrawing recently submitted papers that are awaiting publication. It also now turns out that Dr. Fisher's reanalysis of the study, omitting the contaminated St. Luc data, will not be presented at scientific meetings this month and next, as had been reported in the April 6 issue of The Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The reanalysis is now expected to appear later this year in The New England Journal of Medicine, which published Dr. Fisher's original reports on the breast cancer studies in 1985 and 1989. And in another development, last Friday investigators from the Office of Research Integrity, a unit of the United States Public Health Service that led the Federal investigation of Dr. Poisson, left Montreal in the middle of what was described as a top-priority investigation of falsified data at a second hospital in the study, St. Mary's. The investigators plan to return in late April. Their investigation focuses on an irregularity in a case at St. Mary's that was included in a continuing study of whether the drug tamoxifen can prevent breast cancer among women at high risk of the disease. The date of a patient's mammogram appears to have been falsified by four years on four records found at St. Mary's to make the patient eligible for the tamoxifen study, an official involved in the investigation said. The problem was detected last September but was not reported to the National Cancer Institute until March 25, after its investigators noticed it in records in Pittsburgh. Two weeks ago, Federal health officials said they did not know whether the irregularity was a simple clerical error or something more deliberate. In describing the seriousness of the case last week, Dr. Kaufman said, ""The explanation is unknown but it cannot be trivial."" No other serious irregularity has been detected in an audit of 280 records at St. Mary's, Dr. Kaufman said. The Federal investigation of Dr. Poisson found that among other things, he had changed or fabricated laboratory results of estrogen receptors and other tests of the cancers and the size of the tumors to make patients eligible for the study. Also, several women who signed documents explicitly refusing to participate in the study, in which the choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy was made by lot, were enrolled in it anyway. Because Dr. Poisson's falsified data included material on the drug tamoxifen, the Food and Drug Administration has barred him from conducting drug trials for life. As Mr. Dingell's committee investigates how scientists and Federal officials handle misconduct, the issues raised are likely to reverberate in homes and in hospital corridors around the country. Scientific leaders like to say that researchers rarely falsify data in trials and that the system catches those who do. But the claims are not backed by studies, and many admit privately that their statements may reflect wishful thinking. Mr. Dingell and other members of Congress have long been upset by what they perceive as the lenient way that scientific leaders and the National Institutes of Health have handled fraud and misconduct. And now, in the case of Dr. Fisher, thought of as a star cancer researcher, they confront the possibility that his fall will further erode public trust in medical research. Dr. Thomas Detre, senior vice chancellor of the University of Pittsburgh, and thus Dr. Fisher's ultimate boss, said in an interview that he suspected Dr. Poisson's type of cheating ""happens perhaps more frequently than we are aware of, when physicians for whatever reason want to make their patients eligible for a study, feeling that the disease is life-threatening and they could give them a unique chance."" He added that he thought the researchers had no intention of trying to alter the outcome of the study. Nevertheless, seemingly trivial actions like changing dates in a clinical trial can lead to errors in determining the effectiveness of a therapy under study. For example, if the mammogram of the St. Mary's patient was actually performed four years before the study began, and not within the six-month period specified in the rules for entry into the study, and in the interval she had developed a cancer that was not detected until well into the study, the falsification would have altered the statistical findings. In a worst case situation, the date change might have led to the false conclusion that a therapy under study was ineffective. Dr. Detre pointed out an inherent potential conflict of interest in the way clinical trials are carried out. In order to arrive at statistically meaningful results in clinical trials, large numbers of patients are needed. Organizers of such studies need investigators like Dr. Poisson with large practices to recruit the patients. Most participating doctors take on the added work of a study because of the prestige of being involved in it. For the organizer, the line between encouraging participants to adhere to regulations and insuring that they do so is a fine one, Dr. Detre said, with organizers running the risk of becoming so intrusive that the participating doctors drop out of the study. He added, ""Perhaps we behave far more tactfully than would be indicated."" Many scientific leaders oppose random audits to check on the quality of an investigator's data in research other than clinical trials, contending that such an intrusive move would destroy trust and hamper scientific progress. But the time may have come when that step is necessary, Dr. Detre said, adding that studies are needed to determine how often misconduct occurrs and whether spot checks should be done, what they would cost and who would pay. Data irregularities are supposed to be detected by the routine audits in the study, which are usually overseen by independent committees. Such committees are composed of individuals not connected with the study, to avoid any biases and conflicts of interest if problems arise. The National Institutes of Health are in the process of surveying member institutes to see how often independent data monitoring boards oversee multi-center trials. By periodically examining data during a study, the committees can advise that it be stopped ahead of schedule if the results prove more beneficial or hazardous than expected. The committees can often help detect unusual profiles of participating centers, which might be clues to honest mistakes or even falsifications. Use of such a committee in the Pittsburgh studies could have prevented the catastrophe that has led to this week's Congressional hearing. ""Just having an independent committee makes people think twice before they fabricate things,"" said Dr. Curt D. Furberg, an expert in clinical trials at Bowman Gray School of Medicine in Winston-Salem, N.C. He added, ""I feel sorry for the people who did it right, because there is one guy who discredited the whole program.""  1985 and 1989: New England Journal of Medicine publishes studies indicating lumpectomy is as effective as removing entire breast for many women with early cancer.

For example, if the mammogram of the  patient was actually performed four years before the study began, and not within the six-month period specified in the rules for entry into the study, and in the interval she had developed a cancer that was not detected until well into the study, the falsification would have altered the statistical findings. In a worst case situation, the date change might have led to the false conclusion that a therapy under study was ineffective. Dr.  pointed out an inherent potential conflict of interest in the way clinical trials are carried out. In order to arrive at statistically meaningful results in clinical trials, large numbers of patients are needed. Organizers of such studies need investigators like Dr.  with large practices to recruit the patients. Most participating doctors take on the added work of a study because of the prestige of being involved in it. For the organizer, the line between encouraging participants to adhere to regulations and insuring that they do so is a fine one, Dr.  said, with organizers running the risk of becoming so intrusive that the participating doctors drop out of the study. He added, ""Perhaps we behave far more tactfully than would be indicated."" Many scientific leaders oppose random audits to check on the quality of an investigator's data in research other than clinical trials, contending that such an intrusive move would destroy trust and hamper scientific progress. But the time may have come when that step is necessary, Dr.  said, adding that studies are needed to determine how often misconduct occurrs and whether spot checks should be done, what they would cost and who would pay. Data irregularities are supposed to be detected by the routine audits in the study, which are usually overseen by independent committees. Such committees are composed of individuals not connected with the study, to avoid any biases and conflicts of interest if problems arise. The  are in the process of surveying member institutes to see how often independent data monitoring boards oversee multi-center trials. By periodically examining data during a study, the committees can advise that it be stopped ahead of schedule if the results prove more beneficial or hazardous than expected. The committees can often help detect unusual profiles of participating centers, which might be clues to honest mistakes or even falsifications. Use of such a committee in the  studies could have prevented the catastrophe that has led to this week's ional hearing. ""Just having an independent committee makes people think twice before they fabricate things,"" said Dr. , an expert in clinical trials at  in , . He added, ""I feel sorry for the people who did it right, because there is one guy who discredited the whole program.""  1985 and 1989:  publishes studies indicating lumpectomy is as effective as removing entire breast for many women with early cancer.

"WP",2012,"Afghanistan","The immorality of 'moral crimes'","""Please help us."" Those were the first words that my client, Gulnaz, said when I met her inside the Kabul prison that was home to hundreds of women, many of whom, like her, were locked away for so-called moral crimes - adultery or running away from home. The frail 20-year-old clung to her baby, who was conceived through rape and born on the prison floor, where mother and child had lived for nearly two years. Tearfully, Gulnaz recounted the story of the assault that took place in 2009. The attacker, nearly twice her age, pinned her down, tied her up and then savagely raped her. She described going to the police with her disabled, widowed mother to report the rape. There she was instantly imprisoned for reporting the crime. With no male head of household present, the two women were not taken seriously. After years of advocacy by human rights groups and other activists, and a decade of war by the United States and its allies - a war in which the need to uphold the rights of women has often been invoked - Afghan women remain trapped in a legal system that often punishes them for being the victims of brutal crimes. My illiterate client told me of her experience going to court with her illegitimate daughter and not understanding the legal process. She was forced to represent herself after her Afghan lawyer failed to show up, yet the judges who presided over the case refused to allow her to speak. Instead, they berated Gulnaz for lying, insisting that women cannot get pregnant by having sex just once. This assertion was the basis for the 12-yearâ[#x2c6][#x161] sentence that was imposed, with a wrenching caveat: Marrying her attacker would allow her to be ""free."" Unfortunately, Gulnaz's case is not an anomaly but represents the situation that more than half of the imprisoned women in Afghanistan find themselves in - locked up for moral crimes, according to a recent study by the United Nations. I submitted a pardon application for Gulnaz, accompanied by a petition with more than 6,000 signatures. She had no family willing to take up her cause, but the world, as we discovered, supported her release. Standing up for the rights of women like Gulnaz was part of the reason the United States went to Afghanistan in the first place. In 2001, one of the key political arguments that President George W. Bush's administration used to support the military deployment was stopping the terrorists, for whom""the brutal oppression of women"" was ""a central goal."" In November 2001, Congress passed a bill noting Taliban oppression of women and stressing the need for Afghan women and children to have better access to health care and education. International attention to the fate of women in Afghanistan has been an issue throughout the war. In 2009, the Afghan government focused on violence and human rights when it passed the Elimination of Violence Against Women Law. Though this measure garnered substantial support worldwide, oversight has been limited. The law is largely ignored in Afghanistan's justice system, and abused women are routinely imprisoned as a result. While Gulnaz's case brought international media attention to the plight of Afghan rape victims, inside Afghanistan, gross violations of basic human rights are often business as usual. In Gulnaz's case, after we submitted the pardon application, President Hamid Karzai formed a judicial committee with members from the Ministry of Justice, the Supreme Court and the attorney general's office. They were to investigate Gulnaz's case and, reportedly, the cases of all other women imprisoned in Kabul. The formation of this committee was an unprecedented step for the government: It was directly confronting the realities of women imprisoned for moral crimes. Ultimately, Karzai's investigation found that Gulnaz's conviction was based on oppressive, misogynistic interpretations of Islamic sharia law. These views were in part remnants of the Taliban regime's swift and unforgiving justice system. A more contemporary interpretation of sharia law, Afghan laws and international conventions supported her exoneration. On Dec. 14, 2011, Karzai  acted upon the pardon application and exonerated Gulnaz. He acknowledged that the charge of adultery against her was a ""misjudgment"" and that the cultural norms leading to her imprisonment were long overdue for an overhaul. This decision has the potential to set a precedent for other rape victims seeking justice and is a significant recognition of the persecution that Afghan women have long endured under the veil of cultural appeasement. After 10 years of foreign assistance, it should not have taken the president of Afghanistan to overturn the decisions of three Kabul courts that receive vast amounts of international funding. It should not have taken international media attention to embarrass the Afghan government into finally doing the right thing. And it should not have taken a Western lawyer to give Gulnaz legal representation to achieve exoneration. According to an October reportby the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction, which works to monitor aid spending there by various U.S. governmental agencies, almost $73 billion has been appropriated to Afghanistan since 2002 . This money needs to be used more wisely. Rule-of-law initiatives, particularly on women's rights, have a better chance of success if the international community exercises more oversight and makes a greater effort to understand how the Afghan justice system really works. At present, I am the only Western lawyer in Afghanistan taking on such cases. Gulnaz's case came to me through concerned people who knew of the miscarriages of justice that she endured. I took it to advocate for her and other women in Afghanistan's legal system. Although her case has a suitable ending, it took agitating for attention at the highest levels in the country to get a rape victim out of prison. The laws intended to protect her, and the international initiatives meant to do the same, did nothing. Clearly most of the responsibility should lie with the Afghan government. Prosecutors and judges perpetuate human rights abuses on women, especially in cases involving domestic abuse, with little to no accountability. Because the justice system has failed to deter people within the government from committing human rights abuses, more than half of the women imprisoned in Afghanistan continue to be prosecuted for moral crimes. The government should establish a standing committee within the attorney general's office and the judiciary to ensure that cases of women charged with moral crimes never make it to court - or at the very least, that women are not prosecuted for being victims of violence. From one ""misjudgment"" could come a real chance to save other women from similar suffering. I realize that it may take years, if not generations, for significant improvements on women's rights in Afghanistan. I am optimistic, however, that Gulnaz's case can serve as a turning point to encourage changes that can protect other women enduring her same plight.

"WP",2001,"Palestine","The Second Uprising; Washington still hopes to make peace between Arabs and Jews. But in the West Bank city of Ramallah, Palestinians have returned to a more violent model of nation-building","Tree-shaded and serene, Friends School crowns one of the many hills of Ramallah, a vigorous Palestinian city in the West Bank. Quakers founded the school more than a century ago, and it became a haven of tolerance and enlightenment for Palestinians of all political and religious persuasions. Scenes of studious scholars sheltered among the well-tended gardens of the stately campus evoked the hope for progress, order and the rule of reason. After years of conflict, this dream finally seemed to be taking hold in the 1990s. Peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians nourished a new world glowingly visible on Ramallah's main streets. Rubak's old ice cream shop, purported to be all >Palestine's favorite, reopened on one corner, its glass front no longer shuttered in fear of being shattered in street fighting. Not far away, an artists' cafe debuted, building upon a citywide tradition of tea and coffee houses where customers puff water pipes and play all-night card games. Farther along, toward central Manara Square, boys in new Internet cafes chatted electronically with elusive girls in foreign lands. Women's groups set up offices and fought for rights. Inside a rundown shopping arcade, new wildcat television and radio stations competed for tiny market shares. Radio Love and Peace, the town's most popular station, put its programs online and planned to go satellite -- even though its broadcast signal barely crossed Ramallah city limits. Israelis and Palestinians socialized; an Israeli-led jazz band even played a local nightspot. No more. The collapse of peace talks and the return of civil unrest brought the dream to a screeching end. Right next door to Friends School stands -- or, more accurately, stood -- a new, competing symbol of Ramallah: the local police station. On October 12 a mob, hearing that two Israeli soldiers were being held in police custody, stormed the station and beat the pair to death. One of the killers tossed a body out a window. Another young man leaned out, smiled and displayed blood-soaked hands. A few hours later, Israeli aircraft rocketed the building, reducing it to a heap of stone and plaster. The incident came to represent the speed with which, after years of conflict, uncontrolled passions and a lust for revenge can engulf Ramallah. About 20 Palestinians have been killed in the city since the latest round of sustained unrest erupted last September. They are among some 300 Palestinians and 39 Israelis who died in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza Strip between the beginning of the uprising and the end of the year. Frequent funerals have turned into communal demonstrations of rage. Rubak's ice cream melts for lack of business. Most coffeehouses are closed. Boys from the Internet cafes take up positions at barricades to face Israeli troops. Women's groups deliver first aid for tear gas victims. Radio Love and Peace plays martial music, part of all-uprising, all-the-time programming. Israelis, except by fatal error, don't cross city limits. Only bullets do. For me, a visit to Ramallah was extremely dispiriting. As a foreign correspondent, I'd covered this town, and the rest of the West Bank and Gaza, a decade ago. I had hoped that, after almost 10 years of talks, peace would prevail. By now, the Palestinians were supposed to possess a cozy little state next to Israel. By now, pain and tragedy in these rocky hills were to have faded. Reason would rule over passions. Instead, a new chapter in violence has opened. The speed with which Ramallah transformed itself back into a battleground reflects its dual nature, practically embedded in the city's genetic makeup. Ramallah has long inhabited two worlds. One is the ""normal"" world in which Ramallah became a virtual capital of the embryonic Palestinian state. The other is the realm of underground activity and violence, the legacy of almost a century of conflict. After the September 28 visit of right-wing Israeli politician Ariel Sharon to Jerusalem's al-Aqsa mosque, that universe returned to the forefront with startling speed. It was as if the city had put on a well-worn pair of shoes. Two competing models of Palestinian nation-building are at war in Ramallah. One, born of the 1993 Oslo accords, says we can make peaceful agreements with our enemy, ratified and blessed by Washington, and reap reconciliation and tangible benefits. This is the model Bill Clinton embraced and worked for right up to the last days of his administration. But there's another, born of struggle, which says let's use stones, bullets and force of will to oust the enemy from our land. Evidence of both models is starkly visible on the streets of Ramallah. ""The soul of Ramallah lives on,"" said Marwan Barghouti, a top political operative and agitator in the West Bank, whose personal story reflects the uneasy coexistence of these two visions. ""The soul of resistance lives here."" For anyone seeking refuge from the centuries-old competition over Holy Land real estate, Ramallah possesses one major advantage: It is the home of absolutely nobody's ancient, sacred shrine. Abraham never tried to sacrifice his son in Ramallah and no one wrestled with God on hilltops. Neither Jesus nor his disciples preached in its olive groves. Muhammad didn't tether his horse to a post at the local spring. There are no miracle trees, no ancient temples, no venerated tombs of prophets and saints. Unwitting wanderers need not worry about trampling upon somebody's holy-of-holies. The West Bank is small -- about 80 miles long from north to south and only 40 wide at the thickest part of its waist. Still, most Palestinian towns are rather insular places, whose people consider themselves distinct products of local soil, like varieties of grapes. People from Hebron are regarded as conservative and a little slow. (A joke about Hebronites among Palestinians is the equivalent of a Polish joke in the United States.) Jericho folks are sleepy, their languidness said to result from the broiling summer heat below sea level. Nablus residents are considered rather sour, people in Jerusalem fixated on money. Ramallah, less than a dozen miles north of Jerusalem, is the oddest yet most representative of West Bank cities. Because Palestinians from all over flock to Ramallah, the city defies easy labeling. It is the Palestinian national city. An old legend about Ramallah's founding celebrates the city's open nature. Two families, one Christian and one Muslim, fled clan strife east of the Jordan River. The Christian settled in El Bireh, Ramallah's nearby twin town, and the Muslim found himself in what is now Ramallah. But El Bireh had farmland, which the Muslim desired, and Ramallah possessed trees, which the Christian coveted for firewood. So they traded places. The moral to the story: Avoidance of strife is the mother of prosperity. So it seems that Palestinians have always come to Ramallah to seek practical advantage and comfort. The area is home to the Palestinians' best-known university, Bir Zeit, just to the north. Bir Zeit attracted students from all over, and many of its graduates settled in Ramallah. The university also bequeathed a host of intellectual and political leaders to Ramallah, creating a marketplace of (mostly leftist) ideas. Mild summers at the city's high elevation made Ramallah a vacation spot. King Hussein, during the years Jordan ruled the West Bank, visited frequently, and town officials dutifully organized citizens to line the streets and wave to the monarch. Sheiks from conservative Muslim countries arrived to enjoy the cool air and alcoholic drinks forbidden under Islam. Little red-roofed houses were sprinkled among vineyards. Ramallah became known as ""The Bride of Palestine."" The significant Christian population preached and practiced tolerance; for them, survival meant getting along. Migrants who left to find fortune abroad brought back foreign customs and contributed to a relatively cosmopolitan atmosphere. There's a Mexican restaurant in town called Pollo Loco, a Chinese restaurant called Chinese Restaurant, and a Greek taberna called Greek Taberna. Foreigners came, too. The Quakers established their school in 1869 (the first one was for girls, and there is still a girls' branch). The foreigners put to rest Muslim fears of cultural domination by playing down religious education and opening the school to all. Still, alongside its record of tolerance, Ramallah was always at the forefront of Palestinian nationalism. Just about every party in the messy constellation of Arab politics had a home here. For decades, young men answered the ringing of bells at churches and the muezzin's call from mosques to take up arms and fight Zionists. In the late 1980s, when Palestinians launched the intifada, or uprising, against Israeli rule, Ramallah was the home of the Unified Command, which issued instructions to stone-throwing youths who faced off against Israeli troops then occupying the city. Although the Israeli troops left Ramallah in 1996, they still control the movements of Palestinians in and out of town. Israeli settlements have crept closer and closer to Ramallah. When peace talks faltered, the city's old-time fervor returned. As did the young men, with their rocks, bottles and willingness to die. The City Inn, a hotel on the outskirts of town, is a major clash point in the current fight between Palestinians and Israelis. On any given morning the choreography of conflict goes like this: First, some boys roll a rusty automobile chassis down to the city limits and tip it on its side in the middle of the road to make an instant barricade. A dump truck comes and spills hand-sized stones from a construction site. A sedan speeds from town carrying four discarded tires in its trunk -- these are spread along the barricade to be lit on fire. By noon or so, marchers arrive, waving the red, yellow, white and green flags of different political factions. Freelance rock-tossers drift in. A few practice slingshot skills in a field to one side. Teenage girls hand out onions and perfume (take your pick) as antidotes to tear gas. Spectators gather on the hill above. Some are nearby residents, some are political leaders out to see and be seen. A coffee vendor threads his way through the crowd, bearing a giant pitcher. Coffee is indispensable to any Palestinian gathering, even a dangerous one such as this. All it takes for the program to begin is the arrival of an Israeli counter-blockade. As if on cue, four army jeeps pull into a row just 50 yards from the Palestinians, like a troupe of mechanized Rockettes. Soldiers position themselves behind open jeep doors. Tanks assemble on a hill behind them. Stones fly. Tear gas fills the air. Israelis do most of the shooting. Sometimes, by day's end, Palestinians fire from surrounding buildings. The Israelis unload tank volleys. Often, but not always, someone gets hurt or killed. It is as if the youngsters are engaged in a street version of Russian roulette, taking their chances with Israeli bullets. Except for the drop-by rock-throwers, the spectators and the coffee vendor, the Palestinian participants are highly organized. And this is a striking feature of Ramallah: It lives by organization. Years of strife gave rise to groups born in secrecy. Now largely in the open, those groups are still dedicated to the cause of fighting Israel. Take the stretcher-bearers. They are from the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees. Mustafa Barghouti, a physician, organized the committees to provide health care to Ramallah and outlying areas and training for first-aid teams. The committees got their start during the 1980s intifada against Israeli occupation, the direct predecessor to this one. ""We didn't even have a blood bank then,"" Barghouti recalled. ""We went from neighborhood to neighborhood registering blood types, so when we needed blood, we could come and recruit a donor."" Barghouti first got involved in medicine at the age of 13, during the 1967 Six-Day War when Israel expelled Jordanian troops and occupied Ramallah. Barghouti, then a Boy Scout, took two hours of first-aid training. ""That is the reason I became a doctor. The experience of 1967 has always lingered in my memory. For the intifada, I went into organizing first aid. In those days we had to try to take all the wounded to a hospital. In this battle, we treat them in place. I have 11,000 volunteers in the Ramallah area. We have 45 first-aid teams, like the ones at the barricades."" With some pride, Barghouti said that the scurrying stretcher-bearers are the nucleus of a new generation of activists. ""It's good for the youngsters. They learn how to mobilize. They learn how to serve."" Stone-throwers include out-of-work youths, little boys on their way home for lunch, university students whose majors almost always include a minor in political science. Women, too, are part of the crowd. Young women busily cut stones into hand-sized projectiles. They are from the General Union of Palestinian Women Workers, which was formed in 1980 to resolve women's social problems, promote education and raise workplace standards. That all ended during the intifada. ""We were trying to break with Israel,"" said Manal Abu Ghosh, who heads the union. ""So one of our tasks was to raise vegetables. We also trained women what to do if Israelis come to their home looking to arrest someone. We told them to delay the soldiers as much as possible, but also to put the children, if there are any, in a safe place."" When peace talks progressed, the union went back to defending workplace rights. But now those activities are on hold. Abu Ghosh belongs to a local committee that oversees the uprising in Ramallah. It is a subset of the national Coordination Committee. That committee organizes protests on Fridays and Sundays; scheduling for the rest of the week is up to the Ramallah committee. ""My husband jokes that he should marry two women, one for home and one for the barricades,"" she said over coffee at a downtown hotel. The pair met during the first intifada. He was a member of the Communist Party and on the run, trying to avoid arrest for printing leaflets. ""It was very romantic. We had to meet on rooftops at night,"" Abu Ghosh remembered. That past makes it easy for her husband to understand her shift from labor organizer to resistance leader. It is harder for their children to grasp. Abu Ghosh is reluctant to pass the torch of resistance to them just yet, while they are still young enough to play with Pokemon cards. ""We have two boys and it is hard to explain to them what mommy is doing. The oldest boy -- he's 10 -- wants to go out and throw stones. I tell him mother has her job, which is to organize demonstrations. Their job is to study in school."" She and other women try to send anyone younger than 15 years old home from the barricades. Fifteen- and 16-year-olds she tries to keep at the back of the crowd. ""These ones resist. They call me respectfully 'mother,' but they don't want to leave. It's hard to convince them otherwise. Some of them even say I ought to go back to the kitchen where I belong. ""Look, they feel hemmed in. The Israelis are out of Ramallah, but we are in a big jail. The young people live this reality and they want to fight it."" Abu Ghosh is upset about the glorification of the youthful dead and risky deeds in this uprising. A giant poster of a little boy throwing stones at an Israeli tank, put up at the entrance of town, bothers her. ""It either makes the children want to do careless things, or it makes them afraid they're going to die,"" she said. ""The whole situation is really confusing for them. One day, my son said he wanted to be a [Jewish] settler. He saw them as powerful, people who can do what they want. I had to persuade him that these people are bad."" Palestinians seem to remember everything. Big disasters and little slights -- they all come out in a torrent of remembrance. Bitter memory is a national blood bank. Old refugees who fled their homes in Israel's 1948 independence war describe their abandoned gardens in detail, remember what they carried into exile and the meals they first ate under refugee tents. Palestinians native to Ramallah harbor memories of a different sort, bound up in stories of the various occupations of the West Bank and Gaza -- the British, from 1920 to 1948, the Jordanian from 1948 to 1967, and, especially, the Israeli, which is the longest of the three. At the crest of a hill in the middle of downtown stands Ramallah's memory palace. It is the Grand Hotel, closed for 20 years but still dignified, set amid lawns, gardens and pines. Ida Odeh is the owner. She is as stately as the hotel itself, and her skin has the pinkish glow of the local stone that faces the building. The hotel grew from a boardinghouse in the 1920s into a hotel in the '30s, mostly under the stewardship of Odeh's Lebanese mother. The Grand Hotel was once a magical paradise. You can hardly find a Ramallah native over the age of 40 who does not recall peering into the garden pavilion to glimpse wondrous goings-on. A belly dancer from Pakistan who could gyrate one hour, nonstop. Spanish dance troupes. Trapeze artists. A Jamaican yogi who turned himself into knots (women fainted!). On the eve of the 1967 war, the hotel had booked an orchestra from Beirut. It was to be the first all-Arab group to play there. The gig was canceled. Ramallah's turbulent history is perfectly distilled in Odeh's mind, and her memories swing between episodes of peace and war. Detailed stories about banquets in the garden, the introduction of lemonade (a first for Palestine), the popularity of her chocolate cake, and the antics of Arab dignitaries and their love trysts segue into reminiscences of conflict. The British occupied the hotel during World War II, forcing Odeh's mother to open branches in houses downtown to make a living. The British gave way to the Jordanian army. The country boys from east of the Jordan River set campfires on the precious stone floors. They left the hotel in 1952. In 1967, the Israelis bombed the center of Ramallah and marched in long columns from the west. People ran out to greet them. ""They thought they were Iraqis. They soon learned otherwise,"" said Odeh. The Israelis entered Ramallah and asked for the Grand Hotel, having heard about it on Jordanian radio, which broadcast the music of orchestras playing in the garden. ""No one in Ramallah called it the Grand Hotel. It was just Madame Odeh's place, so for a while, the Jews couldn't find it. But eventually they did. I remember I was sitting right where you are, and in walked an Israeli officer. You could hear a pin drop. He said, 'I'm going to take the top floor.' By night, the garden was full of soldiers. They set up a hospital in the bar. We had to wear a yellow identification card that said we were servants in the house. They were only here 22 days."" The hotel languished. Relations with Israeli military customers were tense; police once investigated Odeh over whether she was overcharging Israelis for hummus. In 1980, her place closed for lack of business. During the first intifada, Palestinian youths used the hotel grounds as an escape route. Different factions cut their own holes in the fence. The Israelis threatened to knock the place down. ""We're still here,"" said Odeh. She wants to turn the place into a cultural center and museum. But the Palestinian police want to turn an adjacent building into a station. It is topped with the same kind of old tile roof as the hotel. ""Suppose the Israelis mistake it for the police and bomb us?"" Thus does Madame Odeh's dream of a peaceful future give way to fear of a violent present. If the Grand Hotel stands for Ramallah's past, then the City Inn was supposed to be its future. It not only offered reliably hot showers to travelers on the Nablus-Jerusalem road, but it was a concrete example of a peace dividend. The City Inn was built by Wefki Kafed, a Palestinian American from a nearby village who emigrated to Puerto Rico in 1973, started small businesses there and in New York, and obtained U.S. citizenship. He returned to Ramallah in the mid-'90s. Americans like Kafed make up a large and energetic community among Ramallah's 40,000 citizens. They are mostly Christians whose forebears migrated to the Americas over the past century. They lived out the American dream and aspire to a Palestinian one: to build a country and its economy from scratch. They speak a language of investment, public stock offerings and globalization. But officially they are here as guests of the Israelis, coming and going on three-month tourist visas. Kafed's father owned a plot of land at a major crossroad on the north-south highway, seemingly a perfect spot for a travelers' way station. Kafed took out a $ 2 million loan and finished the City Inn in 1997. But the inn's location also marks a battlefront. The intersection straddles the line separating Ramallah, which is autonomous Palestinian territory, and West Bank land still patrolled by Israeli troops. Soldiers occupied the hotel when trouble broke out in September. They posted snipers on the top floor, who trashed kitchen equipment. (One day, while I was visiting, Israeli soldiers were busting out the panoramic windows.) Other potential boarders stay away. When Palestinians organize stone-throwing outings, they say, ""Let's go to City Inn."" Said Kafed, ""This kind of advertising, we don't need."" Kafed sounds both wistful and bitter. ""I really believed there would be peace here. The American government seemed interested in peace; the Israelis and the Palestinians seemed interested, too. I took the hint. Now, I'm kicked out of my hotel without a word. They took my laptop computer! They emptied the fridge of shrimp. They took ashtrays."" Before the fighting, he began construction on a new hotel in central Ramallah. Now, he is stuck with two loans. ""I like it here. You can live well. I wanted my five boys to learn Arabic. Now, I've sent the oldest one back. I don't want him throwing stones. What can stones do against rifles? Yaani, no tiene senso,"" he said, sprinkling Arabic and Spanish speech together. ""Like, this doesn't make sense."" His wife, a Venezuelan, wants to go back to New York, he said. ""The truth is, everything could collapse for me here. I still have a house in New York. I like it there, too. But I have these loans . . ."" All business suffers in Ramallah. The ringing of cities by Israeli soldiers smothers commerce. Even before the new violence, Palestinians complained that they could never count on roads being open. Each entrance to every city is like an international boundary where Israelis have the power to stop traffic. Sami Bahour's father left Ramallah for the United States in 1956. Bahour grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, where he developed software. In 1994, he brought his wife and two daughters to Ramallah, because he saw peace on the horizon. ""I'm a full American and a full Palestinian,"" he declared, rejecting a hyphenated identity. ""I can contribute here in a way I can't in the United States. I think the community here appreciates that I am willing to give up the good life in America for Palestine."" He loves his native land. ""Ramallah is cosmopolitan in Palestinian terms. It's a real mix. There are -- or were -- jobs here, and people came from all over. There are all kinds of schools here, and you don't feel religious discrimination."" As general manager for an Arab investment company, Bahour is in charge of developing shopping centers. The first one is under construction in Ramallah. Other businesses in the investment group have paid a price for the new intifada. A car dealership has closed for lack of business and medical and food distribution companies suffer because of restrictions on travel. But Bahour is working hard to keep the shopping center project alive. ""We try to keep construction going on, even under the smell of tear gas. Doing business in these circumstances is just as valuable as throwing stones."" At the barricades, Marwan Barghouti is greeted like a popular politician on the stump. Old men kiss his hand and young activists cluster around to hear his every word. (Barghouti is a cousin of Mustafa Barghouti; the family name is prominent and widespread in Ramallah.) He is a prime example of the starring role that alumni of the first intifada play in this one. Barghouti was a Bir Zeit University student leader turned intifada strategist who preached ""popular resistance"" -- demonstrations, stone-throwing, civil disobedience, mutual aid activities -- anything that mobilized large numbers of people. Israel deported him to Jordan. In this uprising, Barghouti is the West Bank's most prominent leader -- and a man who floats easily from the rhetoric of peaceful grass-roots organization to that of violence. I remember vividly the tense, chaotic Ramallah of the first intifada, which began in December 1987. That uprising's underground leadership lived here and issued stirring leaflets that egged on rock-throwing demonstrators. When Israelis arrested or deported one set of leaders, another took their place. Almost daily, youths hurled stones at Israeli soldiers, who shot at them with live ammunition and rubber-coated bullets. There's a wall near Manara Square where soldiers used to beat Palestinian youths until their bones broke and blood stained the walls. Activists went underground to escape detention, sometimes living in the rocky hills and caves for weeks at a time. Ever-younger brothers and cousins defied parents and common sense alike by throwing themselves at the Israelis. Beyond stone-throwing, there was a darker side. Bands of youths began to target Palestinians suspected of spying for the Israelis. They executed some, sometimes in grisly public spectacles. Stores opened a few hours a day, if at all. Revolt leaders called frequent strikes; Israeli troops tried to force proprietors to open. Or, inversely, the Israelis imposed curfews, closing the city down. All Ramallah tended vegetable gardens to get by. Even now, hearing a metal shutter being pulled down on the streets of the city center sets off a reflex in my mind: Duck! Soldiers must be coming. Operating out of Jordan, Barghouti worked as a middleman between West Bank organizers and the Palestine Liberation Organization, then in exile. His hero was Khalil Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, Yasser Arafat's top lieutenant, who was gunned down by an Israeli commando squad in Tunis in April 1988. Abu Jihad promoted the intifada and overcame PLO fears that success would create an alternate leadership in the West Bank and Gaza. His portrait hangs across from Arafat's in Barghouti's office. ""Palestinians for a long time thought that military struggle was everything. It wasn't. You need other things. Civic struggle, for instance. That lets tens of thousands participate. That idea came from Ramallah,"" Barghouti said proudly. The first intifada broke Israel's will to hold onto the entire West Bank and Gaza Strip, opened the way to peace talks and led to the return of Arafat and the PLO. The organization now rules islands of autonomy through the Palestinian Authority, a government as yet without a state. Barghouti returned from exile in the early 1990s, and now heads West Bank operations for Fatah, the dominant branch of the PLO and the one closest to Arafat. It is an open question whether, through Fatah, Arafat ordered up the current uprising. But it is clear that through Fatah he keeps deeply involved. At the barricades, Fatah members march under the organization's white flag. Many of the stone-throwing boys and young men confronting the Israeli army in the front lines belong to the Fatah Youth Organization, which mobilizes young people across the West Bank and Gaza under its yellow flag. Fatah is the only political organization authorized to carry guns openly, and some of its members admit to using them. Israel flat-out labels Fatah a military organization. Fatah has 130 chapters in the West Bank alone. Its foremost Palestinian rival, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement (green flag), which rejects talks with Israel, comes in a distant second in popularity. For much of the past several years, Barghouti has focused on building grass-roots democracy in Fatah, taking on the trappings of a political party, preparing for a world that allows for peaceful politics. His democratic touch is evident in the casualness of his Ramallah office. Aides, riflemen and student activists enter without a knock. In holding court with reporters, Barghouti pays constant homage to ""the people."" Pointing to a woman sitting on a sofa in his office, he told me that, if I wanted to understand Palestinian frustration, I should speak with her. Her son was killed in 1996 unrest. She is at the barricades every day. Barghouti acknowledged that Fatah, like Ramallah itself, is suspended between normalcy and perpetual combat footing. ""Not everything has changed formally from resistance to politics,"" Barghouti said of Fatah. ""We are moving from the underground to a political party, but we are not there yet."" Barghouti has said he still prefers low- intensity conflict with the Israelis, with the emphasis on demonstrations and stone-throwing, rather than open warfare. But lately he has been preaching more and more the value of the gun. ""You need more than one model,"" he said. ""Armed struggle is a part."" No one in Ramallah doubts that Barghouti acts with the blessing of Arafat. More to the point, many here view Fatah's participation as serving a specific need for the PLO: to shield itself from criticism of the way it runs the Palestinian Authority. Even on today's full plate of anti-Israeli rhetoric, street leaders and armchair activists leave room for verbal assaults on the Sulta, as the Palestinian Authority is known. Opposition politicians -- Ramallah seems overrun with them -- complain mainly about human rights abuses and corruption. ""If the stones weren't flying at the Israelis, they'd be flying at Arafat,"" said Abdul Jawad Saleh, a local member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and critic of the regime. Palestinians contend that politicians connected to the authority have gotten rich overnight. Residents point to giant villas on the Ramallah residential skyline. The authority's finances are questioned. Where does the money go from monopolies on gasoline and tobacco sales? Bribery is endemic: Palestinians are compelled to perform intricate dealings to obtain import permits from the Israelis, who control customs; only Sulta functionaries can ease the way, businessmen say. Last May, Amar Assaf, who belongs to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a longtime Fatah rival, was jailed for 50 days by the Palestinian Authority for opposing peace talks. He said the real reason was because he was trying to organize a teachers union. In any case, Assaf found the arrest ironic. He had spent 10 years in Israeli prisons when Israeli troops still occupied Ramallah. ""When the Palestinian police came to detain me, my wife joked, 'It's been a long time since we've had such visitors here,' "" he said. ""You know, the first intifada rescued the PLO, brought it back. But now there is no rescue. The PLO is naked. It's Arafat's one-man show. Our first task is to expel the Israelis, then we'll take care of the Sulta."" One day in Marwan Barghouti's office a young Fatah member appeared who called himself Amir. He and a friend spoke in low tones to Barghouti about a problem. A TV crew in Amari, a refugee camp within Ramallah's borders, had filmed Amir and some of his armed comrades. He believed the crew was working for Israeli television and that the images would be used to identify them. (The Israelis have acknowledged they have targeted for assassination activists they have identified as involved in violence.) Barghouti dispensed practical advice. He told the young men to travel individually in cars, not together. A big, muscular young man, Amir seemed uneasy talking to a stranger. He answered questions with the fewest words possible. Unlike almost all Palestinians, he would not make eye contact during our conversation. It soon became apparent why. He had spent nine years in Israeli prisons for murder. During the first intifada, Amir belonged to a group of 15 youths in the refugee camp. The band's job was to root out Israeli spies. ""I killed one,"" said Amir. Amir and his cohorts fled to the hills and took cover in little villages where everybody knows everybody. Still, the Israelis nabbed each and every member of the group. Amir was the last. He had let some young women approach him in Kfar Malik, a nearby town. They were Israeli underground agents in drag. The Israelis first sentenced Amir to 18 years in prison, because he was 17. When he turned 18, the sentence was switched to life. He was freed in one of the many prisoner releases that have been part of Israeli-Palestinian negotiations. Amir returned to Ramallah and joined Fatah. He defines his duties as resolving social conflicts in the refugee camp. Amari sits in a depression between Ramallah and El Bireh. It appears to have shared little in the few years of economic promise that followed the Oslo accords. The streets are narrow and lead to dead ends. The construction is ramshackle. New floors, walls and other outcroppings cling like barnacles to older structures. The overcrowding is suffocating. With a few variations, Amari could be a refugee camp in Lebanon, Gaza or Jordan. There are no police around. Just young men like Amir. If they were lucky, like him, they joined the Tanzim, the Arabic word for ""organization,"" referring to the loosely organized Fatah militia, or got a job with the police or with one of the 16 other official security forces that clutter the Palestinian landscape, or with the Sulta. If not, many transferred their secret skills to crime. Auto theft is a key industry in Amari. Amir reminisced about his short, violent life. ""The collaborator I killed was coordinating with Israeli intelligence. Everybody knew it. Some collaborators were allowed to repent. Not him."" Amir said he was locked in a cupboard-size isolation cell for 70 days. The interrogators lost interest after the others told them everything. ""I got life because I was considered the leader,"" he said. Thousands of Palestinians were imprisoned, and their sentences turned into an educational opportunity. They divided themselves up among political factions, held periodic elections and studied political tracts. ""When I got out, I joined the Tanzim,"" he said. ""We have arms to protect ourselves, especially at night, when maybe settlers or soldiers might creep around. Yes, I have shot at the barricades. I have shot at the Jews. We are committed to our leadership's call for no use of arms, but when we see our own people killed, I am forced to fire back. I feel I left jail only to enter a bigger one. The Jews say they want peace, but we are confined to Ramallah. It is like a larger jail. I want to feel free to go to any part of Palestinian land."" Even within Amir, the pull and tug between war and peace is visible. For a moment, he dropped his emotional guard. ""I want to get married, build a life. I started the intifada as a boy and haven't done anything else but fight. I can't even think of doing anything else. Since childhood, I haven't had one beautiful day."" The wrecked police station where the two Israeli soldiers were killed is now a shrine to the martyrs of Ramallah's current initfada. Pictures of men and boys, many young enough to attend Friends School next door, are plastered on what's left of the outer station walls. At night, no police stay at the barracks or any other centralized place for fear of another Israeli attack. Instead, they live in vacant buildings and apartments. The killings of the two soldiers challenged Ramallah's assumptions about itself. The mayhem was captured on TV, forever staining the city's image. The Bride of Palestine had turned into the Bride of Frankenstein. Almost everybody expresses some level of regret, but in the style of the Middle East, regret is wrapped snugly in self-justification. The general line is: You have to understand. People were angry. The Israelis have killed scores of Palestinians. We are fighting an occupation. The police have more trouble making excuses. They are supposed to be above the passions of the moment. Muhammad Ibrahim Abu Ashaf, deputy police chief, was on duty when the two Israelis were brought in. They apparently got lost in Ramallah. Dressed in their soldier uniforms and driving a civilian car, they had arrived downtown while funeral marches of Palestinians killed a few days earlier by Israelis were underway. ""Police rescued them from the mob outside,"" Abu Ashaf recalled over coffee. ""They were trapped in front of Friends School, and the crowd was going to tear them apart. If we had not wanted to save them, we would have just left them out there."" Abu Ashaf is proud of his history in fighting Israel. He, too, was exiled from the West Bank only to return with the PLO. He said he was a pilot, although it wasn't clear in whose air force. As we were talking, a young cop walked into his office, and Abu Ashaf expressed shame at the sometimes sloppy appearance of his men. The police laundry room was destroyed in the air raid on the station, leaving nowhere to clean uniforms. He returned reluctantly to the death of the Israelis. ""It was bad luck. Two funerals were going on at once. We gave the Israelis tea, coffee, water and apples. We didn't even ask them any questions. We seated them in the most secure room. We gave them civilian clothes, to prepare to take them out. But when the crowd rushed in, it was impossible to shoot. It wouldn't have stopped them. It would only have made things worse. There were so many people. They stepped on police, tossed chairs and furniture. They beat the Israelis to death with tables and chairs. I tried to frighten them off by shouting, 'Israeli planes are coming!' But nothing worked. I was worn out. I couldn't stand on my own two feet. ""Crowds get out of control everywhere. Romania, Yugoslavia, California. Sometimes security forces can't stop them. That's not to say we didn't try. The crowd was huge. They pushed through the west gate, a low one that slides. It was suffocating in the station. I myself was pushed off the staircase. Thirteen police were injured. ""How did these two get into town, anyway? Three miles from an Israeli checkpoint? All the way from Betunia? World opinion was in our favor before this. The pictures of the body out the window hurt us badly. We are human beings. Part of the responsibility lies with the Israelis. They are throwing balls of fire at us, and then suddenly two enemies appear among us. What do you expect would happen? This is miserable for them and for us."" Israeli authorities said they picked up some Palestinians involved in the killings in a village outside of Ramallah. Others who stormed the building have disappeared, perhaps remaining in Ramallah. The Israelis contend that at least one policeman participated in the killings. At Friends School next door, Principal Mahmoud Amra remembered seeing the mob and hearing the chants of ""Death to the Jews,"" but didn't know precisely what was going on. ""We first realized something was happening when the crowd burned the car in the street. Then, we heard that the Israelis were going to bomb. So we moved students from a building overlooking the action to the other side of the campus. We wanted to stay away from danger."" ""We promote, as much as possible, nonviolence. In the first intifada, the school was often closed, and many students participated in the conflict. This time, as a school, we have only gone out to demonstrate twice. Otherwise, we celebrate events in school. We cannot stay aloof from our community."" The burnt car of the Israelis has been towed away. Again, young men and boys read quietly under the shade of pine trees. Classes run on schedule and include courses on human rights. ""We talk about the killing of the soldiers,"" said Amra, ""but we also talk about the reaction of the Israelis, the shooting of our people, the collective punishment of the entire West Bank and Gaza. Both things are wrong. Everything is wrong.""","Tree-shaded and serene,  crowns one of the many hills of , a vigorous Palestinian city in the . Quakers founded the school more than a century ago, and it became a haven of tolerance and enlightenment for Palestinians of all political and religious persuasions. Scenes of studious scholars sheltered among the well-tended gardens of the stately campus evoked the hope for progress, order and the rule of reason. After years of conflict, this dream finally seemed to be taking hold in the 1990s. Peace talks between  and the Palestinians nourished a new world glowingly visible on 's main streets. 's old ice cream shop, purported to be all >Palestine's favorite, reopened on one corner, its glass front no longer shuttered in fear of being shattered in street fighting.

Farther along, toward central , boys in new Internet cafes chatted electronically with elusive girls in foreign lands. Women's groups set up offices and fought for rights.

On October 12 a mob, hearing that two i soldiers were being held in police custody, stormed the station and beat the pair to death. One of the killers tossed a body out a window. Another young man leaned out, smiled and displayed blood-soaked hands. A few hours later, i aircraft rocketed the building, reducing it to a heap of stone and plaster. The incident came to represent the speed with which, after years of conflict, uncontrolled passions and a lust for revenge can engulf . About 20 Palestinians have been killed in the city since the latest round of sustained unrest erupted last September. They are among some 300 Palestinians and 39 is who died in clashes in the  and  between the beginning of the uprising and the end of the year. Frequent funerals have turned into communal demonstrations of rage. 's ice cream melts for lack of business. Most coffeehouses are closed.

One is the ""normal"" world in which  became a virtual capital of the embryonic Palestinian state. The other is the realm of underground activity and violence, the legacy of almost a century of conflict. After the September 28 visit of right-wing i politician  to 's al-Aqsa mosque, that universe returned to the forefront with startling speed. It was as if the city had put on a well-worn pair of shoes. Two competing models of Palestinian nation-building are at war in . One, born of the 1993  accords, says we can make peaceful agreements with our enemy, ratified and blessed by , and reap reconciliation and tangible benefits. This is the model  embraced and worked for right up to the last days of his administration. But there's another, born of struggle, which says let's use stones, bullets and force of will to oust the enemy from our land. Evidence of both models is starkly visible on the streets of . ""The soul of  lives on,"" said , a top political operative and agitator in the , whose personal story reflects the uneasy coexistence of these two visions. ""The soul of resistance lives here."" For anyone seeking refuge from the centuries-old competition over Holy Land real estate,  possesses one major advantage: It is the home of absolutely nobody's ancient, sacred shrine.  never tried to sacrifice his son in  and no one wrestled with God on hilltops. Neither  nor his disciples preached in its olive groves.  didn't tether his horse to a post at the local spring.

The  is small -- about 80 miles long from north to south and only 40 wide at the thickest part of its waist. Still, most Palestinian towns are rather insular places, whose people consider themselves distinct products of local soil, like varieties of grapes.

But  had farmland, which the  desired, and  possessed trees, which the Christian coveted for firewood. So they traded places. The moral to the story: Avoidance of strife is the mother of prosperity. So it seems that Palestinians have always come to  to seek practical advantage and comfort. The area is home to the Palestinians' best-known university, Bir Zeit, just to the north. Bir Zeit attracted students from all over, and many of its graduates settled in . The university also bequeathed a host of intellectual and political leaders to , creating a marketplace of (mostly leftist) ideas. Mild summers at the city's high elevation made  a vacation spot. King Hussein, during the years Jordan ruled the , visited frequently, and town officials dutifully organized citizens to line the streets and wave to the monarch. Sheiks from conservative  countries arrived to enjoy the cool air and alcoholic drinks forbidden under Islam. Little red-roofed houses were sprinkled among vineyards.  became known as ""The Bride of Palestine."" The significant Christian population preached and practiced tolerance; for them, survival meant getting along. Migrants who left to find fortune abroad brought back foreign customs and contributed to a relatively cosmopolitan atmosphere. There's a Mexican restaurant in town called Pollo Loco, a Chinese restaurant called Chinese Restaurant, and a Greek taberna called Greek Taberna. Foreigners came, too. The Quakers established their school in 1869 (the first one was for girls, and there is still a girls' branch). The foreigners put to rest  fears of cultural domination by playing down religious education and opening the school to all. Still, alongside its record of tolerance,  was always at the forefront of Palestinian nationalism. Just about every party in the messy constellation of Arab politics had a home here. For decades, young men answered the ringing of bells at churches and the muezzin's call from mosques to take up arms and fight Zionists. In the late 1980s, when Palestinians launched the intifada, or uprising, against i rule,  was the home of the Unified Command, which issued instructions to stone-throwing youths who faced off against i troops then occupying the city. Although the i troops left  in 1996, they still control the movements of Palestinians in and out of town. i settlements have crept closer and closer to . When peace talks faltered, the city's old-time fervor returned. As did the young men, with their rocks, bottles and willingness to die. The City Inn, a hotel on the outskirts of town, is a major clash point in the current fight between Palestinians and is. On any given morning the choreography of conflict goes like this: First, some boys roll a rusty automobile chassis down to the city limits and tip it on its side in the middle of the road to make an instant barricade. A dump truck comes and spills hand-sized stones from a construction site. A sedan speeds from town carrying four discarded tires in its trunk -- these are spread along the barricade to be lit on fire. By noon or so, marchers arrive, waving the red, yellow, white and green flags of different political factions. Freelance rock-tossers drift in. A few practice slingshot skills in a field to one side. Teenage girls hand out onions and perfume (take your pick) as antidotes to tear gas. Spectators gather on the hill above. Some are nearby residents, some are political leaders out to see and be seen. A coffee vendor threads his way through the crowd, bearing a giant pitcher. Coffee is indispensable to any Palestinian gathering, even a dangerous one such as this. All it takes for the program to begin is the arrival of an i counter-blockade. As if on cue, four army jeeps pull into a row just 50 yards from the Palestinians, like a troupe of mechanized Rockettes. Soldiers position themselves behind open jeep doors. Tanks assemble on a hill behind them. Stones fly. Tear gas fills the air. is do most of the shooting. Sometimes, by day's end, Palestinians fire from surrounding buildings. The is unload tank volleys. Often, but not always, someone gets hurt or killed. It is as if the youngsters are engaged in a street version of Russian roulette, taking their chances with i bullets. Except for the drop-by rock-throwers, the spectators and the coffee vendor, the Palestinian participants are highly organized. And this is a striking feature of : It lives by organization. Years of strife gave rise to groups born in secrecy. Now largely in the open, those groups are still dedicated to the cause of fighting . Take the stretcher-bearers. They are from the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees. Mustafa Barghouti, a physician, organized the committees to provide health care to  and outlying areas and training for first-aid teams. The committees got their start during the 1980s intifada against i occupation, the direct predecessor to this one. ""We didn't even have a blood bank then,"" Barghouti recalled. ""We went from neighborhood to neighborhood registering blood types, so when we needed blood, we could come and recruit a donor."" Barghouti first got involved in medicine at the age of 13, during the 1967 Six-Day War when  expelled Jordanian troops and occupied . Barghouti, then a Boy Scout, took two hours of first-aid training. ""That is the reason I became a doctor. The experience of 1967 has always lingered in my memory. For the intifada, I went into organizing first aid. In those days we had to try to take all the wounded to a hospital. In this battle, we treat them in place. I have 11,000 volunteers in the  area. We have 45 first-aid teams, like the ones at the barricades."" With some pride, Barghouti said that the scurrying stretcher-bearers are the nucleus of a new generation of activists. ""It's good for the youngsters. They learn how to mobilize. They learn how to serve."" Stone-throwers include out-of-work youths, little boys on their way home for lunch, university students whose majors almost always include a minor in political science. Women, too, are part of the crowd. Young women busily cut stones into hand-sized projectiles. They are from the General Union of Palestinian Women Workers, which was formed in 1980 to resolve women's social problems, promote education and raise workplace standards. That all ended during the intifada. ""We were trying to break with ,"" said Manal Abu Ghosh, who heads the union. ""So one of our tasks was to raise vegetables. We also trained women what to do if is come to their home looking to arrest someone. We told them to delay the soldiers as much as possible, but also to put the children, if there are any, in a safe place."" When peace talks progressed, the union went back to defending workplace rights. But now those activities are on hold. Abu Ghosh belongs to a local committee that oversees the uprising in . It is a subset of the national Coordination Committee. That committee organizes protests on Fridays and Sundays; scheduling for the rest of the week is up to the  committee. ""My husband jokes that he should marry two women, one for home and one for the barricades,"" she said over coffee at a downtown hotel. The pair met during the first intifada. He was a member of the Communist Party and on the run, trying to avoid arrest for printing leaflets. ""It was very romantic. We had to meet on rooftops at night,"" Abu Ghosh remembered. That past makes it easy for her husband to understand her shift from labor organizer to resistance leader. It is harder for their children to grasp. Abu Ghosh is reluctant to pass the torch of resistance to them just yet, while they are still young enough to play with Pokemon cards. ""We have two boys and it is hard to explain to them what mommy is doing. The oldest boy -- he's 10 -- wants to go out and throw stones. I tell him mother has her job, which is to organize demonstrations. Their job is to study in school."" She and other women try to send anyone younger than 15 years old home from the barricades. Fifteen- and 16-year-olds she tries to keep at the back of the crowd. ""These ones resist. They call me respectfully 'mother,' but they don't want to leave. It's hard to convince them otherwise. Some of them even say I ought to go back to the kitchen where I belong. ""Look, they feel hemmed in. The is are out of , but we are in a big jail. The young people live this reality and they want to fight it."" Abu Ghosh is upset about the glorification of the youthful dead and risky deeds in this uprising. A giant poster of a little boy throwing stones at an i tank, put up at the entrance of town, bothers her. ""It either makes the children want to do careless things, or it makes them afraid they're going to die,"" she said. ""The whole situation is really confusing for them. One day, my son said he wanted to be a [Jewish] settler. He saw them as powerful, people who can do what they want. I had to persuade him that these people are bad."" Palestinians seem to remember everything. Big disasters and little slights -- they all come out in a torrent of remembrance. Bitter memory is a national blood bank. Old refugees who fled their homes in 's 1948 independence war describe their abandoned gardens in detail, remember what they carried into exile and the meals they first ate under refugee tents. Palestinians native to  harbor memories of a different sort, bound up in stories of the various occupations of the  and  -- the British, from 1920 to 1948, the Jordanian from 1948 to 1967, and, especially, the i, which is the longest of the three. At the crest of a hill in the middle of downtown stands 's memory palace. It is the Grand Hotel, closed for 20 years but still dignified, set amid lawns, gardens and pines. Ida Odeh is the owner. She is as stately as the hotel itself, and her skin has the pinkish glow of the local stone that faces the building. The hotel grew from a boardinghouse in the 1920s into a hotel in the '30s, mostly under the stewardship of Odeh's Lebanese mother. The Grand Hotel was once a magical paradise. You can hardly find a  native over the age of 40 who does not recall peering into the garden pavilion to glimpse wondrous goings-on. A belly dancer from Pakistan who could gyrate one hour, nonstop. Spanish dance troupes. Trapeze artists. A Jamaican yogi who turned himself into knots (women fainted!). On the eve of the 1967 war, the hotel had booked an orchestra from Beirut. It was to be the first all-Arab group to play there. The gig was canceled. 's turbulent history is perfectly distilled in Odeh's mind, and her memories swing between episodes of peace and war. Detailed stories about banquets in the garden, the introduction of lemonade (a first for Palestine), the popularity of her chocolate cake, and the antics of Arab dignitaries and their love trysts segue into reminiscences of conflict. The British occupied the hotel during World War II, forcing Odeh's mother to open branches in houses downtown to make a living. The British gave way to the Jordanian army. The country boys from east of the  set campfires on the precious stone floors. They left the hotel in 1952. In 1967, the is bombed the center of  and marched in long columns from the west. People ran out to greet them. ""They thought they were Iraqis. They soon learned otherwise,"" said Odeh. The is entered  and asked for the Grand Hotel, having heard about it on Jordanian radio, which broadcast the music of orchestras playing in the garden. ""No one in  called it the Grand Hotel. It was just Madame Odeh's place, so for a while, the Jews couldn't find it. But eventually they did. I remember I was sitting right where you are, and in walked an i officer. You could hear a pin drop. He said, 'I'm going to take the top floor.' By night, the garden was full of soldiers. They set up a hospital in the bar. We had to wear a yellow identification card that said we were servants in the house. They were only here 22 days."" The hotel languished. Relations with i military customers were tense; police once investigated Odeh over whether she was overcharging is for hummus. In 1980, her place closed for lack of business. During the first intifada, Palestinian youths used the hotel grounds as an escape route. Different factions cut their own holes in the fence. The is threatened to knock the place down. ""We're still here,"" said Odeh. She wants to turn the place into a cultural center and museum. But the Palestinian police want to turn an adjacent building into a station. It is topped with the same kind of old tile roof as the hotel. ""Suppose the is mistake it for the police and bomb us?"" Thus does Madame Odeh's dream of a peaceful future give way to fear of a violent present. If the Grand Hotel stands for 's past, then the City Inn was supposed to be its future. It not only offered reliably hot showers to travelers on the - road, but it was a concrete example of a peace dividend. The City Inn was built by Wefki Kafed, a Palestinian American from a nearby village who emigrated to Puerto Rico in 1973, started small businesses there and in New York, and obtained U.S. citizenship. He returned to  in the mid-'90s. Americans like Kafed make up a large and energetic community among 's 40,000 citizens. They are mostly Christians whose forebears migrated to the Americas over the past century. They lived out the American dream and aspire to a Palestinian one: to build a country and its economy from scratch. They speak a language of investment, public stock offerings and globalization. But officially they are here as guests of the is, coming and going on three-month tourist visas. Kafed's father owned a plot of land at a major crossroad on the north-south highway, seemingly a perfect spot for a travelers' way station. Kafed took out a $ 2 million loan and finished the City Inn in 1997. But the inn's location also marks a battlefront. The intersection straddles the line separating , which is autonomous Palestinian territory, and  land still patrolled by i troops. Soldiers occupied the hotel when trouble broke out in September. They posted snipers on the top floor, who trashed kitchen equipment. (One day, while I was visiting, i soldiers were busting out the panoramic windows.) Other potential boarders stay away. When Palestinians organize stone-throwing outings, they say, ""Let's go to City Inn."" Said Kafed, ""This kind of advertising, we don't need."" Kafed sounds both wistful and bitter. ""I really believed there would be peace here. The American government seemed interested in peace; the is and the Palestinians seemed interested, too. I took the hint. Now, I'm kicked out of my hotel without a word. They took my laptop computer! They emptied the fridge of shrimp. They took ashtrays."" Before the fighting, he began construction on a new hotel in central . Now, he is stuck with two loans. ""I like it here. You can live well. I wanted my five boys to learn Arabic. Now, I've sent the oldest one back. I don't want him throwing stones. What can stones do against rifles? Yaani, no tiene senso,"" he said, sprinkling Arabic and Spanish speech together. ""Like, this doesn't make sense."" His wife, a Venezuelan, wants to go back to New York, he said. ""The truth is, everything could collapse for me here. I still have a house in New York. I like it there, too. But I have these loans . . ."" All business suffers in . The ringing of cities by i soldiers smothers commerce. Even before the new violence, Palestinians complained that they could never count on roads being open. Each entrance to every city is like an international boundary where is have the power to stop traffic. Sami Bahour's father left  for the  in 1956. Bahour grew up in Youngstown, Ohio, where he developed software. In 1994, he brought his wife and two daughters to , because he saw peace on the horizon. ""I'm a full American and a full Palestinian,"" he declared, rejecting a hyphenated identity. ""I can contribute here in a way I can't in the . I think the community here appreciates that I am willing to give up the good life in America for Palestine."" He loves his native land. "" is cosmopolitan in Palestinian terms. It's a real mix. There are -- or were -- jobs here, and people came from all over. There are all kinds of schools here, and you don't feel religious discrimination."" As general manager for an Arab investment company, Bahour is in charge of developing shopping centers. The first one is under construction in . Other businesses in the investment group have paid a price for the new intifada. A car dealership has closed for lack of business and medical and food distribution companies suffer because of restrictions on travel. But Bahour is working hard to keep the shopping center project alive. ""We try to keep construction going on, even under the smell of tear gas. Doing business in these circumstances is just as valuable as throwing stones."" At the barricades,  is greeted like a popular politician on the stump. Old men kiss his hand and young activists cluster around to hear his every word. (Barghouti is a cousin of Mustafa Barghouti; the family name is prominent and widespread in .) He is a prime example of the starring role that alumni of the first intifada play in this one. Barghouti was a Bir Zeit University student leader turned intifada strategist who preached ""popular resistance"" -- demonstrations, stone-throwing, civil disobedience, mutual aid activities -- anything that mobilized large numbers of people.  deported him to Jordan. In this uprising, Barghouti is the 's most prominent leader -- and a man who floats easily from the rhetoric of peaceful grass-roots organization to that of violence. I remember vividly the tense, chaotic  of the first intifada, which began in December 1987. That uprising's underground leadership lived here and issued stirring leaflets that egged on rock-throwing demonstrators. When is arrested or deported one set of leaders, another took their place. Almost daily, youths hurled stones at i soldiers, who shot at them with live ammunition and rubber-coated bullets. There's a wall near  where soldiers used to beat Palestinian youths until their bones broke and blood stained the walls. Activists went underground to escape detention, sometimes living in the rocky hills and caves for weeks at a time. Ever-younger brothers and cousins defied parents and common sense alike by throwing themselves at the is. Beyond stone-throwing, there was a darker side. Bands of youths began to target Palestinians suspected of spying for the is. They executed some, sometimes in grisly public spectacles. Stores opened a few hours a day, if at all. Revolt leaders called frequent strikes; i troops tried to force proprietors to open. Or, inversely, the is imposed curfews, closing the city down. All  tended vegetable gardens to get by. Even now, hearing a metal shutter being pulled down on the streets of the city center sets off a reflex in my mind: Duck! Soldiers must be coming. Operating out of Jordan, Barghouti worked as a middleman between  organizers and the Palestine Liberation Organization, then in exile. His hero was Khalil Wazir, also known as Abu Jihad, Yasser Arafat's top lieutenant, who was gunned down by an i commando squad in Tunis in April 1988. Abu Jihad promoted the intifada and overcame PLO fears that success would create an alternate leadership in the  and . His portrait hangs across from Arafat's in Barghouti's office. ""Palestinians for a long time thought that military struggle was everything. It wasn't. You need other things. Civic struggle, for instance. That lets tens of thousands participate. That idea came from ,"" Barghouti said proudly. The first intifada broke 's will to hold onto the entire  and , opened the way to peace talks and led to the return of Arafat and the PLO. The organization now rules islands of autonomy through the Palestinian Authority, a government as yet without a state. Barghouti returned from exile in the early 1990s, and now heads  operations for Fatah, the dominant branch of the PLO and the one closest to Arafat. It is an open question whether, through Fatah, Arafat ordered up the current uprising. But it is clear that through Fatah he keeps deeply involved. At the barricades, Fatah members march under the organization's white flag. Many of the stone-throwing boys and young men confronting the i army in the front lines belong to the Fatah Youth Organization, which mobilizes young people across the  and  under its yellow flag. Fatah is the only political organization authorized to carry guns openly, and some of its members admit to using them.  flat-out labels Fatah a military organization. Fatah has 130 chapters in the  alone. Its foremost Palestinian rival, Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement (green flag), which rejects talks with , comes in a distant second in popularity. For much of the past several years, Barghouti has focused on building grass-roots democracy in Fatah, taking on the trappings of a political party, preparing for a world that allows for peaceful politics. His democratic touch is evident in the casualness of his  office. Aides, riflemen and student activists enter without a knock. In holding court with reporters, Barghouti pays constant homage to ""the people."" Pointing to a woman sitting on a sofa in his office, he told me that, if I wanted to understand Palestinian frustration, I should speak with her. Her son was killed in 1996 unrest. She is at the barricades every day. Barghouti acknowledged that Fatah, like  itself, is suspended between normalcy and perpetual combat footing. ""Not everything has changed formally from resistance to politics,"" Barghouti said of Fatah. ""We are moving from the underground to a political party, but we are not there yet."" Barghouti has said he still prefers low- intensity conflict with the is, with the emphasis on demonstrations and stone-throwing, rather than open warfare. But lately he has been preaching more and more the value of the gun. ""You need more than one model,"" he said. ""Armed struggle is a part."" No one in  doubts that Barghouti acts with the blessing of Arafat. More to the point, many here view Fatah's participation as serving a specific need for the PLO: to shield itself from criticism of the way it runs the Palestinian Authority. Even on today's full plate of anti-i rhetoric, street leaders and armchair activists leave room for verbal assaults on the Sulta, as the Palestinian Authority is known. Opposition politicians --  seems overrun with them -- complain mainly about human rights abuses and corruption. ""If the stones weren't flying at the is, they'd be flying at Arafat,"" said Abdul Jawad Saleh, a local member of the Palestinian Legislative Council and critic of the regime. Palestinians contend that politicians connected to the authority have gotten rich overnight. Residents point to giant villas on the  residential skyline. The authority's finances are questioned. Where does the money go from monopolies on gasoline and tobacco sales? Bribery is endemic: Palestinians are compelled to perform intricate dealings to obtain import permits from the is, who control customs; only Sulta functionaries can ease the way, businessmen say. Last May, Amar Assaf, who belongs to the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a longtime Fatah rival, was jailed for 50 days by the Palestinian Authority for opposing peace talks. He said the real reason was because he was trying to organize a teachers union. In any case, Assaf found the arrest ironic. He had spent 10 years in i prisons when i troops still occupied . ""When the Palestinian police came to detain me, my wife joked, 'It's been a long time since we've had such visitors here,' "" he said. ""You know, the first intifada rescued the PLO, brought it back. But now there is no rescue. The PLO is naked. It's Arafat's one-man show. Our first task is to expel the is, then we'll take care of the Sulta."" One day in 's office a young Fatah member appeared who called himself Amir. He and a friend spoke in low tones to Barghouti about a problem. A TV crew in Amari, a refugee camp within 's borders, had filmed Amir and some of his armed comrades. He believed the crew was working for i television and that the images would be used to identify them. (The is have acknowledged they have targeted for assassination activists they have identified as involved in violence.) Barghouti dispensed practical advice. He told the young men to travel individually in cars, not together. A big, muscular young man, Amir seemed uneasy talking to a stranger. He answered questions with the fewest words possible. Unlike almost all Palestinians, he would not make eye contact during our conversation. It soon became apparent why. He had spent nine years in i prisons for murder. During the first intifada, Amir belonged to a group of 15 youths in the refugee camp. The band's job was to root out i spies. ""I killed one,"" said Amir. Amir and his cohorts fled to the hills and took cover in little villages where everybody knows everybody. Still, the is nabbed each and every member of the group. Amir was the last. He had let some young women approach him in Kfar Malik, a nearby town. They were i underground agents in drag. The is first sentenced Amir to 18 years in prison, because he was 17. When he turned 18, the sentence was switched to life. He was freed in one of the many prisoner releases that have been part of i-Palestinian negotiations. Amir returned to  and joined Fatah. He defines his duties as resolving social conflicts in the refugee camp. Amari sits in a depression between  and . It appears to have shared little in the few years of economic promise that followed the  accords. The streets are narrow and lead to dead ends. The construction is ramshackle. New floors, walls and other outcroppings cling like barnacles to older structures. The overcrowding is suffocating. With a few variations, Amari could be a refugee camp in Lebanon,  or Jordan. There are no police around. Just young men like Amir. If they were lucky, like him, they joined the Tanzim, the Arabic word for ""organization,"" referring to the loosely organized Fatah militia, or got a job with the police or with one of the 16 other official security forces that clutter the Palestinian landscape, or with the Sulta. If not, many transferred their secret skills to crime. Auto theft is a key industry in Amari. Amir reminisced about his short, violent life. ""The collaborator I killed was coordinating with i intelligence. Everybody knew it. Some collaborators were allowed to repent. Not him."" Amir said he was locked in a cupboard-size isolation cell for 70 days. The interrogators lost interest after the others told them everything. ""I got life because I was considered the leader,"" he said. Thousands of Palestinians were imprisoned, and their sentences turned into an educational opportunity. They divided themselves up among political factions, held periodic elections and studied political tracts. ""When I got out, I joined the Tanzim,"" he said. ""We have arms to protect ourselves, especially at night, when maybe settlers or soldiers might creep around. Yes, I have shot at the barricades. I have shot at the Jews. We are committed to our leadership's call for no use of arms, but when we see our own people killed, I am forced to fire back. I feel I left jail only to enter a bigger one. The Jews say they want peace, but we are confined to . It is like a larger jail. I want to feel free to go to any part of Palestinian land."" Even within Amir, the pull and tug between war and peace is visible. For a moment, he dropped his emotional guard. ""I want to get married, build a life. I started the intifada as a boy and haven't done anything else but fight. I can't even think of doing anything else. Since childhood, I haven't had one beautiful day."" The wrecked police station where the two i soldiers were killed is now a shrine to the martyrs of 's current initfada. Pictures of men and boys, many young enough to attend  next door, are plastered on what's left of the outer station walls. At night, no police stay at the barracks or any other centralized place for fear of another i attack. Instead, they live in vacant buildings and apartments. The killings of the two soldiers challenged 's assumptions about itself. The mayhem was captured on TV, forever staining the city's image. The Bride of Palestine had turned into the Bride of Frankenstein. Almost everybody expresses some level of regret, but in the style of the Middle East, regret is wrapped snugly in self-justification. The general line is: You have to understand. People were angry. The is have killed scores of Palestinians. We are fighting an occupation. The police have more trouble making excuses. They are supposed to be above the passions of the moment.  Ibrahim Abu Ashaf, deputy police chief, was on duty when the two is were brought in. They apparently got lost in . Dressed in their soldier uniforms and driving a civilian car, they had arrived downtown while funeral marches of Palestinians killed a few days earlier by is were underway. ""Police rescued them from the mob outside,"" Abu Ashaf recalled over coffee. ""They were trapped in front of , and the crowd was going to tear them apart. If we had not wanted to save them, we would have just left them out there."" Abu Ashaf is proud of his history in fighting . He, too, was exiled from the  only to return with the PLO. He said he was a pilot, although it wasn't clear in whose air force. As we were talking, a young cop walked into his office, and Abu Ashaf expressed shame at the sometimes sloppy appearance of his men. The police laundry room was destroyed in the air raid on the station, leaving nowhere to clean uniforms. He returned reluctantly to the death of the is. ""It was bad luck. Two funerals were going on at once. We gave the is tea, coffee, water and apples. We didn't even ask them any questions. We seated them in the most secure room. We gave them civilian clothes, to prepare to take them out. But when the crowd rushed in, it was impossible to shoot. It wouldn't have stopped them. It would only have made things worse. There were so many people. They stepped on police, tossed chairs and furniture. They beat the is to death with tables and chairs. I tried to frighten them off by shouting, 'i planes are coming!' But nothing worked. I was worn out. I couldn't stand on my own two feet. ""Crowds get out of control everywhere. Romania, Yugoslavia, California. Sometimes security forces can't stop them. That's not to say we didn't try. The crowd was huge. They pushed through the west gate, a low one that slides. It was suffocating in the station. I myself was pushed off the staircase. Thirteen police were injured. ""How did these two get into town, anyway? Three miles from an i checkpoint? All the way from Betunia? World opinion was in our favor before this. The pictures of the body out the window hurt us badly. We are human beings. Part of the responsibility lies with the is. They are throwing balls of fire at us, and then suddenly two enemies appear among us. What do you expect would happen? This is miserable for them and for us."" i authorities said they picked up some Palestinians involved in the killings in a village outside of . Others who stormed the building have disappeared, perhaps remaining in . The is contend that at least one policeman participated in the killings. At  next door, Principal Mahmoud Amra remembered seeing the mob and hearing the chants of ""Death to the Jews,"" but didn't know precisely what was going on. ""We first realized something was happening when the crowd burned the car in the street. Then, we heard that the is were going to bomb. So we moved students from a building overlooking the action to the other side of the campus. We wanted to stay away from danger."" ""We promote, as much as possible, nonviolence. In the first intifada, the school was often closed, and many students participated in the conflict. This time, as a school, we have only gone out to demonstrate twice. Otherwise, we celebrate events in school. We cannot stay aloof from our community."" The burnt car of the is has been towed away. Again, young men and boys read quietly under the shade of pine trees. Classes run on schedule and include courses on human rights. ""We talk about the killing of the soldiers,"" said Amra, ""but we also talk about the reaction of the is, the shooting of our people, the collective punishment of the entire  and . Both things are wrong. Everything is wrong."""
"NYT",1981,"Canada","THE STRUGGLE OF WOMEN DIRECTORS","The past couple of days had been tough ones for the young film director. The filming the day before had involved difficult set-ups in the middle of Lake Ontario in a pitching boat. The weather was foul, the schedule tight and a few of the actors were seasick. The next morning, there was a fire on a set in an old Tudor mansion in Toronto that wiped out four hours of shooting. ''I keep waiting for the panic,'' said Candace O'Connor, the young Canadian actress who is one of the stars of the film. ''By now, this place should be in an absolute uproar. I guess a woman's just different. Annette's being simply marvelous.'' What Annette Cohen and her cast and crew were engaged in is a unique film project: an anthology of nine short vignettes on the subject of love, all of them written by women (Antonia Fraser, Liv Ullmann, Gael Greene, Germaine Greer, Mai Zetterling, Penelope Gilliatt, Nancy Dowd, Edna O'Brien and Joni Mitchell), directed by women (Annette Cohen, Liv Ullmann, Mai Zetterling and Nancy Dowd), and produced by a woman (Renee Perlmutter, a Canadian making her first movie with her own company, Coup Films Ltd.) ''Love,'' a moderately budgeted, internationally financed film, is the biggest thing to come along for women in the movie industry since 1933, when Dorothy Arzner directed Katharine Hepburn in ''Christopher Strong.'' Unfortunately, however, women directors as a class are not faring well today. At the time the four female directors were at work in Toronto, there was not a single woman directing cameras on a movie set anywhere in the United States. True, Claudia Weill's ''It's My Turn'' has been playing to good audiences throughout the country since it opened in October and Lee Grant's ''Tell Me a Riddle'' opened last month to generally favorable reviews. But, for the most part, women directors feel the film industry in the United States discriminates against them on an almost unprecedented scale. Of course, film directing is one of the most exclusive professions in the world, with only a handful of men or women ever getting the opportunity to direct a major motion picture. If it's difficult for men, women feel that for them it sometimes seems nearly impossible.  Men in the film industry, from studio bosses to directors, are defensive on the subject. They acknowledge that sexist attitudes persist, but they claim that opportunities for women to direct have never been better. The trouble, they say, is that, with one or two exceptions, first-rate ''mainstream'' women directors have not emerged who combine the creative and leadership qualities needed to handle multimillion dollar projects. Many women, these men say, want to make women's pictures. This notion is angrily rejected by aspiring women directors, and they are making the industry aware of the depth of their frustration and bitterness. The motion-picture industry, and television, is male-oriented and always has been, these women say. Movies are still financed by banks, and banks, they contend, are unwilling to bet large sums of money on women directors. The women point out that when a male director is temperamental, this is often considered part of his artistic genius; when a woman is temperamental, she is ''acting like a woman'' and is not to be trusted. When a man produces an expensive flop, he is judged as an individual and generally given another chance. When one woman fails, all women are tainted. Whatever the reason, the statistics suggest that women are being short shrifted. Last June, a committee of women members of the Directors Guild of America invited executives of all the major studios and television networks, as well as some large independent production companies, to a meeting in the guild's Los Angeles headquarters. The producers were presented with a package of statistics that pointed out that of the 7,332 feature films (not including documentaries or films made by small independent production companies) released by major distributors during the last 30 years, only 14, or two-tenths of 1 percent, were directed by women. And that out of 65,500 hours of national network, prime-time dramatic television for the same period, only 115 hours (mostly productions concerned with female themes), or two-tenths of 1 percent, were directed by women. The statistics may be a little misleading in that they include only feature films released by major distributors and do not include small, independent productions - films that did not receive major distribution and promotion - or documentaries, industrial and educational films. Nor do the television statistics include publictelevision productions, which have a better record of employing women directors. Nevertheless, it is films released by the big distributors that are seen by the larger public; these are the films that have the opportunity to make money -the rest, too often, really do not count commercially. It may seem, also, at first glance, that in the last few years, things have changed for the better. Joan Darling directed ''First Love.'' Joan Tewkesbury directed ''Old Boyfriends.'' But one look at the production statistics for some representative major studios for 1978-1979, the last year for which complete statistics are available, illustrate graphically what women directors find themselves up against: Columbia Studios. Feature films. Female directors: 0. Male 11.  Television episodes. Female directors: 1. Male directors: 138. Universal Studios. Category, feature films. Female directors: 0.  Male directors: 17. Television episodes: Female directors: 2. Male directors: 381. Paramount Studios. Feature films. Female directors: 0. Male directors: 8. Television episodes: Female directors: 1. Male directors: 211. ''We know how hard it is for men to become directors in this industry -very hard,'' Nell Cox, a committee member, told the executives at the meeting, ''but the odds against women are apparently 99.8 percent harder.'' Many of the male executives at the meeting expressed shock and dismay at the statistics and said they had no idea that things were so bad. o aid in righting the balance, the women's committee proposed an affirmative-action program and the formation of a resource group of prominent men and women - including such industry heavyweights as Claire Townsend, vice president of the production of features at 20th Century Fox, and Verna Fields, her counterpart at Universal Studios -who would meet with selected women directors, assess their work and report back to the guild. After the meeting, a lot of letters went out to production staffs from studio heads who wanted to put themselves on record for supporting the women's aims and who declared their intentions to do better. Fundamentally, however, little has changed as yet.  During their discussions with executives, the committee members emphasized the absence of women from episodic television, which is the real center of the film industry today. It's where young male directors get their training. It's where directors can make a living while learning and polishing their craft - an opportunity that, with the exception of ''soft'' shows like ''The Waltons'' and ''Family,'' is largely denied to women, who are caught in a seemingly inescapable ''Catch-22'' situation. Women are told they can't direct episodic television or movies because they don't have enough hours of directing under their belt. And they can't acquire those hours because no one hires them to direct. While men entering the industry encounter similar problems, the women claim that their experiences are infinitely worse because of sexism. Occasionally, the established female star of a television show will direct an episode or two. Nancy Walker, for example, did some 'Rhodas'' and ''Mary Tyler Moores,'' and Penny Marshall did a couple of ''Laverne & Shirleys.'' But most of the top shows have regular directors who lock themselves into a series, and very few of those regulars are women. The exclusion operates on every level. When she was still a film editor, Verna Fields (who is widely acknowledged to have saved more directors' hides in the cutting room than most of them would care to admit) was suggested as the director for ''Jaws II'' (she won an Academy Award for editing ''Jaws'') after another director fell by the wayside. But, she says, ''I was told I couldn't do it, because, according to guild rules, in order to replace another director, I had to have directed one feature (film) or 90 minutes of television, and, (technically), on paper, I hadn't.'' Barbara Peters, a veteran low-budget action-and-exploitation film director reports that when ''I was teaching a directing course at an experimental film college in Los Angeles, I helped one student shoot and put together a 10-minute videotape to use as his calling card.  With it, he immediately got an episode of 'The Incredible Hulk' to direct. I couldn't even get an interview on that show.'' Although production companies are willing to look at test videotapes in the hope of unearthing a new young directing talent, few of them seem to consider the possibility that that talent could be female. Jan Haag, a woman film director who administers the American Film Institute's (West Coast branch) programs to aid film makers, explains: ''Young men come out of our Center for Advanced Film Studies and go straight into jobs in TV and film. The women in our workshops produce tapes ... many of which are as good or better than the men's, yet they can't get a look in.'' Increasing numbers of women are also coming out of other film schools, but their chances have not appreciably changed as yet. Adell Aldrich, daughter of veteran director Robert Aldrich, began her career as a script supervisor at the age of 16. ''My father,'' she says, ''started off his career as a craft serviceman, going for coffee, and moved from third assistant, slowly but steadily, through the ranks to director. ... My family told ... me the men in the industry simply didn't see women in that light. They were right. It took me 18 years to be given the opportunity to direct (small-budget films for independent studios).'' Other women seem stuck permanently in assistant-director or second-assistant director ruts while their male counterparts move up more steadily to directors' chairs.  Why has an industry which may have had a woman as its first storyfilm director (it is hotly debated whether Alice Guy-Blache, who directed ''La Fee Aux Choux,'' made in Paris in 1896, was the first person to direct a story film), an industry which allowed the late Dorothy Arzner to become one of the top 10 Hollywood directors in the 30's, been so resistant to giving opportunity to women directors since World War II? There was one notable exception in this worst of times for women directors in America. Ida Lupino, tired as an actress of waiting for the right films to come along, formed her own production company with her then husband, the late Collier Young, and between 1949 and 1954 directed, produced and wrote eight feature films, characterized by their tough subject matter and their provocative picture of American life beneath the surface, and went on to do shows for television. Ida Lupino's films were low-budget, fast-shoot independent. Her first feature ''Not Wanted'' (1949), the tale of an unwed mother who gives up her baby and then kidnaps another, cost $110,000 to make and grossed $1 million. It might have been characterized as a women's picture, but one could certainly not say the same of the ''The Hitch-Hiker,'' an all-male suspense drama shot in 1953, of which a contemporary reviewer wrote: ''It is breathtakingly keyed to an agonizing pitch of terror for its full running time.'' In the three decades since, no other woman has managed to amass a similar body of work. One possible explanation of the phenomenon is that the history of women as film directors has simply not been fully documented. As the writer-director Nancy Dowd pointed out in Action magazine in 1973, the history of the great directors began to be written in the 50's, spurred on by the French creators of the auteur theory, wherein directors, not stories, became preeminent. When the interest spread to America, it did so in a climate that was scarcely sensitive to women's efforts. ''It was the era of the feminine mystique,'' wrote Nancy Dowd, ''of Jayne Mansfield, Betty Crocker cake mixes, Dior waists, crinolines and Mamie Eisenhower. ... ''The cultural blinders of the era,'' she continued, ''blunted (the historians') scholarship. They simply did not see, or could not believe, or preferred to forget, that women had been among the first film makers, that women had made distinguished films, that women directors had amassed significant filmographies.'' Women also tended to have been allowed to direct when directing wasn't considered all that important. Under the old studio system, the ranks of journeymen directors could well include an Ida Lupino.  Once the director became the star, from the mid-50's on, women were, to all intents and purposes, passed over. It became easier to ignore women as directors. The one woman who could not be ignored, because she was so obviously a cinematic genius, Leni Riefenstahl, was easily discredited because of her Nazi connections. Some male industry leaders today rush to explain the dearth of women directors. Women don't have the technical skill to direct.  Women can't ''control the floor.'' Male crews don't respect them.  Women are stubborn, inflexible and won't compensate. Women make heavy-handed ''messagey'' films that no one wants to see. Women don't have the physical stamina. ''Directing for television is a very, very tough job,'' says Douglas S. Cramer, a co-executive producer with Aaron Spelling Productions (the company that makes ''The Love Boat'' and ''Vega$''). ''It's a merciless, constant pounding. It's gruelling. I don't want to sound like a chauvinist, but I don't know if a woman could stand up to it.'' ''It's easy to blame male chauvinism,'' says Harry Ufland, one of Los Angeles's most successful agents (with a reputation for launching many first-time directors, none of them women), ''but it's quite simply that no woman except Elaine May has ever made a good movie, and her last one, 'Mikey and Nicky,' never got finished. Everyone knows how brilliant she is, but no one will trust her with a film.  The rest of the women's stuff I've seen is just awful.'' It is difficult for a neophyte male director today to get a production company to take a chance on him. It is virtually impossible for a woman. She simply adds an extra layer of risk in an already risky formula. At the present uncertain time in the movie industry, what with the advent of home video cassettes, cable and other new software, no one is quite sure who the audience is anymore. No one, therefore, is inclined to take risks, and women directors are perceived as the greatest risk of all. Film producers claim that budgets today are too big for them to entrust a movie to a woman. And television producers say their budgets are too small to risk the mistakes an untested woman director might make. Money and power move the film industry. Women have traditionally had neither. Banks, which lend money for films, are notoriously conservative, but, say women directors, they become positively Scrooge-like when a woman is at the helm of a picture. And there is little indication that the introduction of women's banks has made any difference. But first, and fundamentally, the word ''director,'' like ''general,'' continues to have a primarily male connotation.  Fay Kanin, who is currently president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, head of her own production company, and writer and/or co-producer of such television hits as ''Friendly Fire,'' ''Hustling'' and ''Tell Me Where It Hurts,'' explains it this way: ''The director is a papa figure. We were always told women couldn't exercise authority over a bunch of men. It's nonsense, of course. Some women are lousy at authority. But then, so are some men.'' But old conditionings die hard.  Verna Fields sits in her large, prestigious vice president's office at Universal Studios, surrounded by posters of some of the successful films she's edited, and admits, ''To be honest, my early education has never really left me. It's like how you feel passing a nun, even though you've given up Catholicism a long time ago. It will take several generations in this industry to get over our subservience to the male gender.'' It may be this early conditioning that produces a profound lack of confidence in the women themselves when they decide to try their hand at directing. As Barbra Streisand, who is widely believed to have virtually ''directed'' many of the films she has starred in over the years, prepares to make her official movie directing debut with the musical ''Yentl'' for her own production company, she is, accord-ing to a woman who has worked closely with her, ''so scared, she's making herself ill.'' The fear, of course, comes from the visibility of failure. A man makes a bad movie and it's John Doe who's made a bomb. When a woman fails, it's ''women'' who can't direct. A ''Moment by Moment'' or a ''Can't Stop the Music'' sets every woman who has ever directed, or wanted to direct, back a decade. A ''Heaven's Gate'' or a ''1941'' would finish them forever. But such monumental failures by men are regarded as momentary aberrations by otherwise gifted directors. A Robert Altman can direct a string of failures and still get ''Popeye.'' Ken Russell can produce embarrassment after embarrassment and go on to ''Altered States.'' The injustice galls. ''We want the same opportunity to make fools of ourselves as the men,'' says Nancy Walker, who directed ''Can't Stop the Music.'' If nervous studio heads these days watch young male directors closely - and they do -the scrutiny is multiplied tenfold for women.  ''It was like being in a fishbowl,'' says Claudia Weill of her experience with Columbia Pictures on ''It's My Turn.' (The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin said the movie was ''full of brief, telling details that Miss Weill somehow makes unexpectedly interesting.'') ''I heard (the production people),'' she reports, ''talking to the crew - 'You mean she took five takes (not an inordinate amount) on that?' 'What the hell is she doing?' -that kind of thing.'' The new breed of women production executives at studios can go only so far to help.  ''They'll bring up a woman director's name a couple of times,'' says Barbara Peters, ''then they simply have to let it drop.  Otherwise, they might be asked, 'What's the matter with you, can't you work with a man?''' There are, however, small signs of hope. The presence of women executives at several major studios may represent the best chance for a change. New studios in town, like Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope, are apparently receptive to women directors and are actively seeking projects from them. Lucy Fisher, who started in the industry as a studio reader 12 years ago and is now vice president for worldwide productions at Zoetrope, says, ''We've been interested in women making films since before it became fashionable.'' And she points out that it makes good sense to hire new people, both male and female, to direct. ''The public certainly hasn't been too happy with the caliber of movies they have been getting lately from the same old people,'' she adds, ''so why go back to them just because you know them?'' At 20th Century Fox, Sherry Lansing says she is discussing a development deal with Karen Arthur, director of ''Legacy,'' and one with Gilliam Armstrong, director of ''My Brilliant Career,'' and there are several others cooking which she does not want to discuss until they become settled. She, however, emphasizes that she has trouble answering when she is asked how many projects with women directors her studio has. ''I simply don't break them down into male and female,'' she says. ''We have some projects we're talking about with terrific directors, and, yes, some of them happen to be women.'' ''I've seen some wonderful films by women,'' Sherry Lansing adds.  ''Elaine May did two of the best films I've ever seen. I loved 'It's My Turn.' I've seen brilliant work from Joan Silver, Beth Brickell, a director called Evelyn Demme and Amy Heckerling, and there're lots more. ... Six months from now, I'm sure we'll have several projects under way with women at the helm.'' Most woman directors agree that big-name actresses -those with enough clout to have director approval -could help by insisting that a woman be at least considered in the running to make their pictures. But it rarely happens. When Jane Fonda was asked at the 1975 San Francisco Film Festival why she had never worked with a woman director, she said there weren't any. ''Later,'' says Karen Arthur, who was honored at the festival as one of three outstanding new directors of the year, ''I asked her if she'd view some of my films. She refused. She had told the woman who had directed her in a documentary ... on Vietnam ...  that women shouldn't direct.'' A spokesman for Jane Fonda quotes the actress as saying, ''It's totally false. I don't recall ever meeting Miss Arthur, but if I refused to see her films it was because I didn't have the time.'' The one thing on which even their critics agree is that women directors are especially sensitive in their handling of actors.  On the set of ''Love'' in Canada, Candace O'Connor explained that from an actor's point of view in a story involving rather explicit sex, a woman director is a plus all around. ''I keep waiting for Annette Cohen to say, 'Oh, for God's sake, Candace, relax -so it's a nude scene, so what?' I've heard it so often from men. But I know she won't. There are just some things I don't have to explain to a woman.'' Candace O'Connor's male co-star, Robin Ward, was equally enthusiastic: ''I've worked for women directors often in the theater. This is my first experience with one in films, and I can tell you that, given my druthers, I prefer a woman director. They're so much more willing to discuss things with you. There is none of that mysteriousness that some of the male directors seem to enjoy wrapping things up with.'' Ideally, a significant influx of women on the directorial scene would add a whole new perspective to the human experience: the filmic equivalents of Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Drabble or Joan Didion. It was evident in ''The Heartbreak Kid,'' a satire on the ethnic male's fantasy of the WASP princess that could surely only have been done justice to by an ethnic female like Elaine May. It was evident in ''Hester Street,'' Joan Micklin Silver's film of an immigrant woman growing up to the realization of her own strength. It was evident in Lee Grant's short film ''The Stronger,'' wherein Strindberg's old tale of two women battling over a man became an altogether different story in which the man was a virtual irrelevancy. And it is there in her new film, ''Tell Me a Riddle,'' in which flashbacks are used not simply to detail a dying old woman's past but to let the audience into her imagery, to show not only what the woman is thinking, but how she thinks it. But some women directors have felt impotent and deprived of selfexpression for so long that, in their frustration, what sometimes comes out when they finally do get the chance to direct is hostile feminist excess: films in which too much time is spent dealing with menstruation, rape and abortion - the kind of wallow that few women, and even fewer men, want to sit through. These are probably the kind of excesses that first efforts inevitably bring, and will pass, but many women think that the time has come for female directors to put aside the overall subject of ''women'' for a while.''I find them so icky,'' says Mai Zetterling (once billed as the ''Swedish Sex Bomb,'' now a well-regarded director in Europe), ''all this adoration of the tummy - women standing in front of mirrors oiling pregnant bellies.'' Most women directors are not interested in pouring their anger onto the screen, nor are they interested in being pigeonholed.  Nancy Dowd, who wrote the original story of ''Coming Home'' and the raunchy, brutal script for the movie ''Slap Shot,'' about the very male sport of ice hockey and is making her directorial debut in ''Love,'' asks, ''How come no one is interested in what a woman thinks about freedom?'' Small subjects, films about interpersonal relationships -the kind of pictures European film makers, both male and female, make - these are the pictures that the majority of women directors say they want to make. But, too often in America, these are contemptuously tagged ''women's pictures'' by studio heads, who consider them the kiss of death at the box office. Despite the success of films like ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ''Ordinary People'' (voted 1980's best film by the New York Film Critics Circle), the suggestion is that people aren't ready for real life on the screen. In Europe, the picture has traditionally been somewhat brighter for women. Directors like Lina Wertmuller, Mai Zetterling, Agnes Varda and, in Britain, Betty Box have found a market for their incisive, satirical looks at their societies' foibles. But the European movie is a vastly different animal from the American breed. There, movies are still regarded as individual artistic efforts. And in North America, the Canadians have traditionally had more room for women, because, explains the producer Renee Perlmutter, ''Our country is too young to have an old-boy network that disdains women. We have a whole different sensibility to our sex.'' But even in Canada, it is significant that the French-speaking section of the country has many more women film directors than the English section. In the United States, however, any woman who wants to direct finds herself struggling with one key question: Can her sensibilities ever fit into a financial reality that says the average cinema goer is a 14-to 24-year-old male? Karen Arthur, who will begin shooting her third major motion picture, ''Lady Beware,'' in April, and had to raise her $4 million budget from independent investors after Universal, which had optioned the project, dropped out, says, ''I battled endlessly with (a studio head) over the picture. There was one scene where the girl goes to do her laundry and finds the crotch cut out of her panties and the nipples out of her bras. Any woman would be completely terrified by that. (He) thought it was funny.'' ''I can relate to 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Apocalypse Now,''' she adds, ''but it appears a man can't relate to my world. It's the essence of the problem.'' Thwarted in their attempt to make major feature films, some women directors have tried a different route. Barbara Peters, who doesn't mind being called ''the Queen of B Pictures,'' has been making exploitation films - like ''Humanoids from the Deep,'' ''Moving Violation'' and ''Candy Striped Nurses'' -heavy on sex and violence and packed with car crashes, stunts and chases. She believes that more women would make action pictures if they weren't so intimidated. ''Look, it's like a bunch of little girls trying to get into the boy's baseball game,'' she says, ''and being told, 'Go away, you're not good enough.' So they say, 'O.K., we'll go over to Mary Jane's yard and play our own game.' They stick to what the men aren't doing.'' One area which has become a safe haven for women is the documentary field, and many and varied have been the contributions of women directors to it. But in the United States, documentaries are considered nonprestigious and uncommercial, i.e., they don't make money. The field is one in which a woman can get stuck and from which there is relatively little movement into feature films. ''We shouldn't try to be protected from the battle,'' declares Karen Arthur, ''just because we haven't been to war before. I adored those meetings with (a studio head). They gave me a chance to sharpen my negotiating talents. They taught me how to work him better, how to manipulate. Men are battle-scarred from these meetings. They know the players. We don't even begin to understand the rules.'' So far, the biggest commercial success for a woman director since Elaine May's ''Heartbreak Kid'' belongs to Claudia Weill, who had to put together three grants to make her first success, ''Girlfriends,'' a modest little picture which convinced Columbia Pictures to ante up $7 million for ''It's My Turn.'' Before these two films, Miss Weill, who has been working in film production ever since her student days at Radcliffe, produced and directed the documentary, ''Joyce at 34'' and did some 20 segments of ''Sesame Street'' for public television before directing ''The Other Half of the Sky,'' the chronicle of Shirley Maclaine's trip to China which won an Academy Award nomination. Before ''It's My Turn'' was released, it was reportedly mucked about with considerably. Hollywood sources say that the producer Ray Stark had so little confidence in Miss Weill that he took the film away from her for editing. But Ray Stark has a reputation for being crass and insensitive with directors, male or female, and many women expressed little sympathy for Miss Weill's plight. ''What exactly did she expect,'' snorts Nancy Dowd. ''Anybody who makes a film for Ray Stark must expect the worst.'' Nevertheless, the film survived and audiences are seeing it, and the next woman to come along may find it easier because of Miss Weill's success. Box office returns on the film are excellent, an indication that if given the big studio treatment - major distribution, widespread advertising and marketing - a woman's film can be just as succcessful as any other good, well-promoted film.  Meanwhile, the fate of women directors is unenviable. They make ends meet by teaching, stage directing or consulting on films directed by men. They live frugally, and they keep moving. Joan Tewkesbury, whose first film, ''Old Boyfriends,'' brought her a flurry of attention, and who has just finished shooting ''The Acorn People,'' a Movie of the Week for NBC-TV, says, ''You've got to keep the momentum going. I'm moving to New York to do more theater. You can get awfully stale in this town sitting around listening to all the deals the boys are making.'' Nancy Dowd is writing a play for England's National Theater. Some women are even making movies. Joan Micklin Silver, who has a production company with her husband, will begin shooting ''Medallion,'' a contemporary thriller in the political arena, sometime in 1981, and Lee Grant is planning a comedy ''chase'' film for shooting next spring. Others are still trying to get projects off the ground. Adell Aldrich's ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Martha Hinkle,'' starring Valerie Perrine, is currently being considered by several studios. Amy Heckerling's ''My Kind of Guy'' went the rounds from Universal to M-G-M before being dropped - a common enough experience, but evidently more so when women directors are involved. Meanwhile, many women search for a mentor - usually a male producer -who will in some way further their career. Or they write, hoping to tie themselves to a commercial project that the studios want enough to let them direct. And always there's the struggle to raise money. ''You have endless dinners with men whom you convince yourself are interested in investing in your movie,'' says Karen Arthur, ''when all the time they're looking at your breasts. They evaporate when you suggest getting together with your lawyer.'' Sometimes the temptation to give up is overwhelming. Joelle Dobrow, a news and specials director, says, ''It's crisis time for me. If it doesn't happen in the next six years, it's all over. I'm not 22 anymore. I'm a director, it's all I know. What am I supposed to do, open a restaurant?'' Elaine May, the woman director with perhaps the most talent, has apparently given up directing films, because Polly Platt says, ''She did it for her personal life. This can be a very defeating town and at some point you have to say, what am I giving up for this?  The resource committee appointed by the Directors Guild to look into the plight of women in films had been scheduled to make its final report by last Oct. 8. The guild's national executive secretary, Michael H. Franklin, waited at the appointed time. Not one member of the committee showed up, nor were any apologies sent. A top executive at a major studio said that on the advice of a labor-relations lawyer it was decided that by taking part in this program the studio would be locking itself into voluntary mandates and putting itself in jeopardy. Lawyers for the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers say that the resource committee was in trouble on several counts. The National Labor Relations Act prohibits the making of employment decisions on the basis of guild membership and the group met only with guild members. Also, by restricting their interview candidates women, says the A.M.P.T.P. lawyer, the resource committee was discriminating against other minorities in the guild. But it was clearly stated at the women's meeting with the producers that other minorities would be next, that this was simply the first in a series of such affirmative-action efforts. Unofficially, members of the producers' association complain that the guild is simply playing politics. ''They were facing the threat of suits from their own women members,'' says one lawyer. ''They're simply trying to protect their own rear ends by passing the buck to the producers.'' Nevertheless, an angry national board of the Directors Guild voted to file a complaint for discrimination against the production companies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which will hear the case on Jan. 19. It may do them little good, and it could produce a backlash. ''If a man has a woman forced on him,'' says 20th Century Fox vice president Claire Townsend, ''he'll hate her. He'll want her to fail. And it will do more damage to women further down the line.'' The prospects for women directors are perhaps most promising for actresses who are interested in directing: people like Barbra Streisand, Lee Grant, Anne Bancroft (who made her directorial debut with ''Fatso''), Dyan Cannon, whose short film ''Number One'' was well received and was nominated for an Academy Award, and Lee Remick, who plans to direct her next film. These women could make it to a secure stephold because they have the visibility and clout that the others lack. They are accustomed to dealing with the power brokers, and they have the added advantage of being able to finance their efforts by their acting. ''I edited 'Tell Me a Rid-dle' while acting in 'Charlie Chan,''' says Lee Grant, ''and finished the mixing (while) doing 'The Fright' in Montreal. It's exhausting, but it works.'' Most reasonable people in the industry agree, however, that there simply hasn't been a sufficient body of work from any woman director to really tell who, if any, is likely to have staying power. Watching from the sidelines, Polly Platt, a production designer/producer who with her former husband, Peter Bogdanovitch, launched such successful films as ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''What's Up, Doc?'' says that, regrettably, she has not yet seen anyone she considers a really exciting talent among the ranks of women directors. ''But just to keep things in perspective,'' she says, ''don't forget that John Ford made (over 130) films, the first 45 of them were absolutely lousy. And Peter and I plowed through many of Hitchcock's efforts made in England. Most of (the very early ones) were quite dreadful.'' Fay Kanin is optimistic: ''If anyone had told me 10 years ago that there'd be so many women producers today, I wouldn't have believed it. It's just snowballed. I know it'll be harder for directors, but it will come. How much harder, is the question.  For every film that actually gets to the screen, there are 50 to 100 in development that never make it. That means it takes over 100 production executives to make about five films. Becoming a director, therefore, is approximately 20 times more competitive than being a producer. No wonder then, as Fay Kanin admits, ''It's going to be two steps forward and three back for a while, but it will come. Sherry says we'll get to the day when none of us will have 'woman' as (an automatic) prefix stuck in front of our title.'' For women directors that day can't come soon enough.","The past couple of days had been tough ones for the young film director. The filming the day before had involved difficult set-ups in the middle of  in a pitching boat. The weather was foul, the schedule tight and a few of the actors were seasick. The next morning, there was a fire on a set in an old  mansion in  that wiped out four hours of shooting. ''I keep waiting for the panic,'' said , the young Canadian actress who is one of the stars of the film. ''By now, this place should be in an absolute uproar. I guess a woman's just different.

What  and her cast and crew were engaged in is a unique film project: an anthology of nine short vignettes on the subject of love, all of them written by women (, , , , , , ,  and ), directed by women (, ,  and ), and produced by a woman (, a Canadian making her first movie with her own company, ) ''Love,'' a moderately budgeted, internationally financed film, is the biggest thing to come along for women in the movie industry since 1933, when  directed  in ''.'' Unfortunately, however, women directors as a class are not faring well today. At the time the four female directors were at work in , there was not a single woman directing cameras on a movie set anywhere in the . True, 's ''It's My Turn'' has been playing to good audiences throughout the country since it opened in October and 's ''Tell Me a Riddle'' opened last month to generally favorable reviews. But, for the most part, women directors feel the film industry in the  discriminates against them on an almost unprecedented scale. Of course, film directing is one of the most exclusive professions in the world, with only a handful of men or women ever getting the opportunity to direct a major motion picture. If it's difficult for men, women feel that for them it sometimes seems nearly impossible.  Men in the film industry, from studio bosses to directors, are defensive on the subject. They acknowledge that sexist attitudes persist, but they claim that opportunities for women to direct have never been better. The trouble, they say, is that, with one or two exceptions, first-rate ''mainstream'' women directors have not emerged who combine the creative and leadership qualities needed to handle multimillion dollar projects. Many women, these men say, want to make women's pictures. This notion is angrily rejected by aspiring women directors, and they are making the industry aware of the depth of their frustration and bitterness. The motion-picture industry, and television, is male-oriented and always has been, these women say. Movies are still financed by banks, and banks, they contend, are unwilling to bet large sums of money on women directors. The women point out that when a male director is temperamental, this is often considered part of his artistic genius; when a woman is temperamental, she is ''acting like a woman'' and is not to be trusted. When a man produces an expensive flop, he is judged as an individual and generally given another chance. When one woman fails, all women are tainted. Whatever the reason, the statistics suggest that women are being short shrifted. Last June, a committee of women members of the  invited executives of all the major studios and television networks, as well as some large independent production companies, to a meeting in the guild's  headquarters. The producers were presented with a package of statistics that pointed out that of the 7,332 feature films (not including documentaries or films made by small independent production companies) released by major distributors during the last 30 years, only 14, or two-tenths of 1 percent, were directed by women. And that out of 65,500 hours of national network, prime-time dramatic television for the same period, only 115 hours (mostly productions concerned with female themes), or two-tenths of 1 percent, were directed by women. The statistics may be a little misleading in that they include only feature films released by major distributors and do not include small, independent productions - films that did not receive major distribution and promotion - or documentaries, industrial and educational films. Nor do the television statistics include publictelevision productions, which have a better record of employing women directors. Nevertheless, it is films released by the big distributors that are seen by the larger public; these are the films that have the opportunity to make money -the rest, too often, really do not count commercially. It may seem, also, at first glance, that in the last few years, things have changed for the better.  directed ''First Love.''  directed ''Old Boyfriends.'' But one look at the production statistics for some representative major studios for 1978-1979, the last year for which complete statistics are available, illustrate graphically what women directors find themselves up against: . Feature films. Female directors: 0. Male 11.  Television episodes. Female directors: 1. Male directors: 138. . Category, feature films. Female directors: 0.  Male directors: 17. Television episodes: Female directors: 2. Male directors: 381. . Feature films. Female directors: 0. Male directors: 8. Television episodes: Female directors: 1. Male directors: 211. ''We know how hard it is for men to become directors in this industry -very hard,'' , a committee member, told the executives at the meeting, ''but the odds against women are apparently 99.8 percent harder.'' Many of the male executives at the meeting expressed shock and dismay at the statistics and said they had no idea that things were so bad. o aid in righting the balance, the women's committee proposed an affirmative-action program and the formation of a resource group of prominent men and women - including such industry heavyweights as , vice president of the production of features at 20th Century , and , her counterpart at  -who would meet with selected women directors, assess their work and report back to the guild. After the meeting, a lot of letters went out to production staffs from studio heads who wanted to put themselves on record for supporting the women's aims and who declared their intentions to do better. Fundamentally, however, little has changed as yet.  During their discussions with executives, the committee members emphasized the absence of women from episodic television, which is the real center of the film industry today. It's where young male directors get their training. It's where directors can make a living while learning and polishing their craft - an opportunity that, with the exception of ''soft'' shows like ''The '' and ''Family,'' is largely denied to women, who are caught in a seemingly inescapable ''Catch-22'' situation. Women are told they can't direct episodic television or movies because they don't have enough hours of directing under their belt. And they can't acquire those hours because no one hires them to direct. While men entering the industry encounter similar problems, the women claim that their experiences are infinitely worse because of sexism. Occasionally, the established female star of a television show will direct an episode or two. Nancy Walker, for example, did some 'Rhodas'' and ''Mary Tyler Moores,'' and Penny Marshall did a couple of ''Laverne & Shirleys.'' But most of the top shows have regular directors who lock themselves into a series, and very few of those regulars are women. The exclusion operates on every level. When she was still a film editor,  (who is widely acknowledged to have saved more directors' hides in the cutting room than most of them would care to admit) was suggested as the director for ''Jaws II'' (she won an Academy Award for editing ''Jaws'') after another director fell by the wayside. But, she says, ''I was told I couldn't do it, because, according to guild rules, in order to replace another director, I had to have directed one feature (film) or 90 minutes of television, and, (technically), on paper, I hadn't.'' Barbara Peters, a veteran low-budget action-and-exploitation film director reports that when ''I was teaching a directing course at an experimental film college in , I helped one student shoot and put together a 10-minute videotape to use as his calling card.  With it, he immediately got an episode of 'The Incredible Hulk' to direct. I couldn't even get an interview on that show.'' Although production companies are willing to look at test videotapes in the hope of unearthing a new young directing talent, few of them seem to consider the possibility that that talent could be female. Jan Haag, a woman film director who administers the American Film Institute's (West Coast branch) programs to aid film makers, explains: ''Young men come out of our Center for Advanced Film Studies and go straight into jobs in TV and film. The women in our workshops produce tapes ... many of which are as good or better than the men's, yet they can't get a look in.'' Increasing numbers of women are also coming out of other film schools, but their chances have not appreciably changed as yet. Adell Aldrich, daughter of veteran director Robert Aldrich, began her career as a script supervisor at the age of 16. ''My father,'' she says, ''started off his career as a craft serviceman, going for coffee, and moved from third assistant, slowly but steadily, through the ranks to director. ... My family told ... me the men in the industry simply didn't see women in that light. They were right. It took me 18 years to be given the opportunity to direct (small-budget films for independent studios).'' Other women seem stuck permanently in assistant-director or second-assistant director ruts while their male counterparts move up more steadily to directors' chairs.  Why has an industry which may have had a woman as its first storyfilm director (it is hotly debated whether Alice Guy-Blache, who directed ''La Fee Aux Choux,'' made in Paris in 1896, was the first person to direct a story film), an industry which allowed the late  to become one of the top 10 Hollywood directors in the 30's, been so resistant to giving opportunity to women directors since World War II? There was one notable exception in this worst of times for women directors in America. Ida Lupino, tired as an actress of waiting for the right films to come along, formed her own production company with her then husband, the late Collier Young, and between 1949 and 1954 directed, produced and wrote eight feature films, characterized by their tough subject matter and their provocative picture of American life beneath the surface, and went on to do shows for television. Ida Lupino's films were low-budget, fast-shoot independent. Her first feature ''Not Wanted'' (1949), the tale of an unwed mother who gives up her baby and then kidnaps another, cost $110,000 to make and grossed $1 million. It might have been characterized as a women's picture, but one could certainly not say the same of the ''The Hitch-Hiker,'' an all-male suspense drama shot in 1953, of which a contemporary reviewer wrote: ''It is breathtakingly keyed to an agonizing pitch of terror for its full running time.'' In the three decades since, no other woman has managed to amass a similar body of work. One possible explanation of the phenomenon is that the history of women as film directors has simply not been fully documented. As the writer-director  pointed out in Action magazine in 1973, the history of the great directors began to be written in the 50's, spurred on by the French creators of the auteur theory, wherein directors, not stories, became preeminent. When the interest spread to America, it did so in a climate that was scarcely sensitive to women's efforts. ''It was the era of the feminine mystique,'' wrote , ''of Jayne Mansfield, Betty Crocker cake mixes, Dior waists, crinolines and Mamie Eisenhower. ... ''The cultural blinders of the era,'' she continued, ''blunted (the historians') scholarship. They simply did not see, or could not believe, or preferred to forget, that women had been among the first film makers, that women had made distinguished films, that women directors had amassed significant filmographies.'' Women also tended to have been allowed to direct when directing wasn't considered all that important. Under the old studio system, the ranks of journeymen directors could well include an Ida Lupino.  Once the director became the star, from the mid-50's on, women were, to all intents and purposes, passed over. It became easier to ignore women as directors. The one woman who could not be ignored, because she was so obviously a cinematic genius, Leni Riefenstahl, was easily discredited because of her Nazi connections. Some male industry leaders today rush to explain the dearth of women directors. Women don't have the technical skill to direct.  Women can't ''control the floor.'' Male crews don't respect them.  Women are stubborn, inflexible and won't compensate. Women make heavy-handed ''messagey'' films that no one wants to see. Women don't have the physical stamina. ''Directing for television is a very, very tough job,'' says Douglas S. Cramer, a co-executive producer with Aaron Spelling Productions (the company that makes ''The Love Boat'' and ''Vega$''). ''It's a merciless, constant pounding. It's gruelling. I don't want to sound like a chauvinist, but I don't know if a woman could stand up to it.'' ''It's easy to blame male chauvinism,'' says Harry Ufland, one of 's most successful agents (with a reputation for launching many first-time directors, none of them women), ''but it's quite simply that no woman except Elaine May has ever made a good movie, and her last one, 'Mikey and Nicky,' never got finished. Everyone knows how brilliant she is, but no one will trust her with a film.  The rest of the women's stuff I've seen is just awful.'' It is difficult for a neophyte male director today to get a production company to take a chance on him. It is virtually impossible for a woman. She simply adds an extra layer of risk in an already risky formula. At the present uncertain time in the movie industry, what with the advent of home video cassettes, cable and other new software, no one is quite sure who the audience is anymore. No one, therefore, is inclined to take risks, and women directors are perceived as the greatest risk of all. Film producers claim that budgets today are too big for them to entrust a movie to a woman. And television producers say their budgets are too small to risk the mistakes an untested woman director might make. Money and power move the film industry. Women have traditionally had neither. Banks, which lend money for films, are notoriously conservative, but, say women directors, they become positively Scrooge-like when a woman is at the helm of a picture. And there is little indication that the introduction of women's banks has made any difference. But first, and fundamentally, the word ''director,'' like ''general,'' continues to have a primarily male connotation.  Fay Kanin, who is currently president of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, head of her own production company, and writer and/or co-producer of such television hits as ''Friendly Fire,'' ''Hustling'' and ''Tell Me Where It Hurts,'' explains it this way: ''The director is a papa figure. We were always told women couldn't exercise authority over a bunch of men. It's nonsense, of course. Some women are lousy at authority. But then, so are some men.'' But old conditionings die hard.   sits in her large, prestigious vice president's office at , surrounded by posters of some of the successful films she's edited, and admits, ''To be honest, my early education has never really left me. It's like how you feel passing a nun, even though you've given up Catholicism a long time ago. It will take several generations in this industry to get over our subservience to the male gender.'' It may be this early conditioning that produces a profound lack of confidence in the women themselves when they decide to try their hand at directing. As Barbra Streisand, who is widely believed to have virtually ''directed'' many of the films she has starred in over the years, prepares to make her official movie directing debut with the musical ''Yentl'' for her own production company, she is, accord-ing to a woman who has worked closely with her, ''so scared, she's making herself ill.'' The fear, of course, comes from the visibility of failure. A man makes a bad movie and it's John Doe who's made a bomb. When a woman fails, it's ''women'' who can't direct. A ''Moment by Moment'' or a ''Can't Stop the Music'' sets every woman who has ever directed, or wanted to direct, back a decade. A ''Heaven's Gate'' or a ''1941'' would finish them forever. But such monumental failures by men are regarded as momentary aberrations by otherwise gifted directors. A Robert Altman can direct a string of failures and still get ''Popeye.'' Ken Russell can produce embarrassment after embarrassment and go on to ''Altered States.'' The injustice galls. ''We want the same opportunity to make fools of ourselves as the men,'' says Nancy Walker, who directed ''Can't Stop the Music.'' If nervous studio heads these days watch young male directors closely - and they do -the scrutiny is multiplied tenfold for women.  ''It was like being in a fishbowl,'' says  of her experience with Columbia Pictures on ''It's My Turn.' (The New York Times film critic Janet Maslin said the movie was ''full of brief, telling details that Miss Weill somehow makes unexpectedly interesting.'') ''I heard (the production people),'' she reports, ''talking to the crew - 'You mean she took five takes (not an inordinate amount) on that?' 'What the hell is she doing?' -that kind of thing.'' The new breed of women production executives at studios can go only so far to help.  ''They'll bring up a woman director's name a couple of times,'' says Barbara Peters, ''then they simply have to let it drop.  Otherwise, they might be asked, 'What's the matter with you, can't you work with a man?''' There are, however, small signs of hope. The presence of women executives at several major studios may represent the best chance for a change. New studios in town, like Francis Ford Coppola's Zoetrope, are apparently receptive to women directors and are actively seeking projects from them. Lucy Fisher, who started in the industry as a studio reader 12 years ago and is now vice president for worldwide productions at Zoetrope, says, ''We've been interested in women making films since before it became fashionable.'' And she points out that it makes good sense to hire new people, both male and female, to direct. ''The public certainly hasn't been too happy with the caliber of movies they have been getting lately from the same old people,'' she adds, ''so why go back to them just because you know them?'' At 20th Century , Sherry Lansing says she is discussing a development deal with Karen Arthur, director of ''Legacy,'' and one with Gilliam Armstrong, director of ''My Brilliant Career,'' and there are several others cooking which she does not want to discuss until they become settled. She, however, emphasizes that she has trouble answering when she is asked how many projects with women directors her studio has. ''I simply don't break them down into male and female,'' she says. ''We have some projects we're talking about with terrific directors, and, yes, some of them happen to be women.'' ''I've seen some wonderful films by women,'' Sherry Lansing adds.  ''Elaine May did two of the best films I've ever seen. I loved 'It's My Turn.' I've seen brilliant work from Joan Silver, Beth Brickell, a director called Evelyn Demme and Amy Heckerling, and there're lots more. ... Six months from now, I'm sure we'll have several projects under way with women at the helm.'' Most woman directors agree that big-name actresses -those with enough clout to have director approval -could help by insisting that a woman be at least considered in the running to make their pictures. But it rarely happens. When Jane Fonda was asked at the 1975 San Francisco Film Festival why she had never worked with a woman director, she said there weren't any. ''Later,'' says Karen Arthur, who was honored at the festival as one of three outstanding new directors of the year, ''I asked her if she'd view some of my films. She refused. She had told the woman who had directed her in a documentary ... on Vietnam ...  that women shouldn't direct.'' A spokesman for Jane Fonda quotes the actress as saying, ''It's totally false. I don't recall ever meeting Miss Arthur, but if I refused to see her films it was because I didn't have the time.'' The one thing on which even their critics agree is that women directors are especially sensitive in their handling of actors.  On the set of ''Love'' in Canada,  explained that from an actor's point of view in a story involving rather explicit sex, a woman director is a plus all around. ''I keep waiting for  to say, 'Oh, for God's sake, Candace, relax -so it's a nude scene, so what?' I've heard it so often from men. But I know she won't. There are just some things I don't have to explain to a woman.'' 's male co-star, Robin Ward, was equally enthusiastic: ''I've worked for women directors often in the theater. This is my first experience with one in films, and I can tell you that, given my druthers, I prefer a woman director. They're so much more willing to discuss things with you. There is none of that mysteriousness that some of the male directors seem to enjoy wrapping things up with.'' Ideally, a significant influx of women on the directorial scene would add a whole new perspective to the human experience: the filmic equivalents of Joyce Carol Oates, Margaret Drabble or Joan Didion. It was evident in ''The Heartbreak Kid,'' a satire on the ethnic male's fantasy of the WASP princess that could surely only have been done justice to by an ethnic female like Elaine May. It was evident in ''Hester Street,'' Joan Micklin Silver's film of an immigrant woman growing up to the realization of her own strength. It was evident in 's short film ''The Stronger,'' wherein Strindberg's old tale of two women battling over a man became an altogether different story in which the man was a virtual irrelevancy. And it is there in her new film, ''Tell Me a Riddle,'' in which flashbacks are used not simply to detail a dying old woman's past but to let the audience into her imagery, to show not only what the woman is thinking, but how she thinks it. But some women directors have felt impotent and deprived of selfexpression for so long that, in their frustration, what sometimes comes out when they finally do get the chance to direct is hostile feminist excess: films in which too much time is spent dealing with menstruation, rape and abortion - the kind of wallow that few women, and even fewer men, want to sit through. These are probably the kind of excesses that first efforts inevitably bring, and will pass, but many women think that the time has come for female directors to put aside the overall subject of ''women'' for a while.''I find them so icky,'' says  (once billed as the ''Swedish Sex Bomb,'' now a well-regarded director in Europe), ''all this adoration of the tummy - women standing in front of mirrors oiling pregnant bellies.'' Most women directors are not interested in pouring their anger onto the screen, nor are they interested in being pigeonholed.  , who wrote the original story of ''Coming Home'' and the raunchy, brutal script for the movie ''Slap Shot,'' about the very male sport of ice hockey and is making her directorial debut in ''Love,'' asks, ''How come no one is interested in what a woman thinks about freedom?'' Small subjects, films about interpersonal relationships -the kind of pictures European film makers, both male and female, make - these are the pictures that the majority of women directors say they want to make. But, too often in America, these are contemptuously tagged ''women's pictures'' by studio heads, who consider them the kiss of death at the box office. Despite the success of films like ''Kramer vs. Kramer'' and ''Ordinary People'' (voted 1980's best film by the New York Film Critics Circle), the suggestion is that people aren't ready for real life on the screen. In Europe, the picture has traditionally been somewhat brighter for women. Directors like Lina Wertmuller, , Agnes Varda and, in Britain, Betty Box have found a market for their incisive, satirical looks at their societies' foibles. But the European movie is a vastly different animal from the American breed. There, movies are still regarded as individual artistic efforts. And in North America, the Canadians have traditionally had more room for women, because, explains the producer , ''Our country is too young to have an old-boy network that disdains women. We have a whole different sensibility to our sex.'' But even in Canada, it is significant that the French-speaking section of the country has many more women film directors than the English section. In the , however, any woman who wants to direct finds herself struggling with one key question: Can her sensibilities ever fit into a financial reality that says the average cinema goer is a 14-to 24-year-old male? Karen Arthur, who will begin shooting her third major motion picture, ''Lady Beware,'' in April, and had to raise her $4 million budget from independent investors after Universal, which had optioned the project, dropped out, says, ''I battled endlessly with (a studio head) over the picture. There was one scene where the girl goes to do her laundry and finds the crotch cut out of her panties and the nipples out of her bras. Any woman would be completely terrified by that. (He) thought it was funny.'' ''I can relate to 'The Deer Hunter' and 'Apocalypse Now,''' she adds, ''but it appears a man can't relate to my world. It's the essence of the problem.'' Thwarted in their attempt to make major feature films, some women directors have tried a different route. Barbara Peters, who doesn't mind being called ''the Queen of B Pictures,'' has been making exploitation films - like ''Humanoids from the Deep,'' ''Moving Violation'' and ''Candy Striped Nurses'' -heavy on sex and violence and packed with car crashes, stunts and chases. She believes that more women would make action pictures if they weren't so intimidated. ''Look, it's like a bunch of little girls trying to get into the boy's baseball game,'' she says, ''and being told, 'Go away, you're not good enough.' So they say, 'O.K., we'll go over to Mary Jane's yard and play our own game.' They stick to what the men aren't doing.'' One area which has become a safe haven for women is the documentary field, and many and varied have been the contributions of women directors to it. But in the , documentaries are considered nonprestigious and uncommercial, i.e., they don't make money. The field is one in which a woman can get stuck and from which there is relatively little movement into feature films. ''We shouldn't try to be protected from the battle,'' declares Karen Arthur, ''just because we haven't been to war before. I adored those meetings with (a studio head). They gave me a chance to sharpen my negotiating talents. They taught me how to work him better, how to manipulate. Men are battle-scarred from these meetings. They know the players. We don't even begin to understand the rules.'' So far, the biggest commercial success for a woman director since Elaine May's ''Heartbreak Kid'' belongs to , who had to put together three grants to make her first success, ''Girlfriends,'' a modest little picture which convinced Columbia Pictures to ante up $7 million for ''It's My Turn.'' Before these two films, Miss Weill, who has been working in film production ever since her student days at Radcliffe, produced and directed the documentary, ''Joyce at 34'' and did some 20 segments of ''Sesame Street'' for public television before directing ''The Other Half of the Sky,'' the chronicle of Shirley Maclaine's trip to China which won an Academy Award nomination. Before ''It's My Turn'' was released, it was reportedly mucked about with considerably. Hollywood sources say that the producer Ray Stark had so little confidence in Miss Weill that he took the film away from her for editing. But Ray Stark has a reputation for being crass and insensitive with directors, male or female, and many women expressed little sympathy for Miss Weill's plight. ''What exactly did she expect,'' snorts . ''Anybody who makes a film for Ray Stark must expect the worst.'' Nevertheless, the film survived and audiences are seeing it, and the next woman to come along may find it easier because of Miss Weill's success. Box office returns on the film are excellent, an indication that if given the big studio treatment - major distribution, widespread advertising and marketing - a woman's film can be just as succcessful as any other good, well-promoted film.  Meanwhile, the fate of women directors is unenviable. They make ends meet by teaching, stage directing or consulting on films directed by men. They live frugally, and they keep moving. , whose first film, ''Old Boyfriends,'' brought her a flurry of attention, and who has just finished shooting ''The Acorn People,'' a Movie of the Week for NBC-TV, says, ''You've got to keep the momentum going. I'm moving to New York to do more theater. You can get awfully stale in this town sitting around listening to all the deals the boys are making.''  is writing a play for England's National Theater. Some women are even making movies. Joan Micklin Silver, who has a production company with her husband, will begin shooting ''Medallion,'' a contemporary thriller in the political arena, sometime in 1981, and  is planning a comedy ''chase'' film for shooting next spring. Others are still trying to get projects off the ground. Adell Aldrich's ''Twinkle, Twinkle, Martha Hinkle,'' starring Valerie Perrine, is currently being considered by several studios. Amy Heckerling's ''My Kind of Guy'' went the rounds from Universal to M-G-M before being dropped - a common enough experience, but evidently more so when women directors are involved. Meanwhile, many women search for a mentor - usually a male producer -who will in some way further their career. Or they write, hoping to tie themselves to a commercial project that the studios want enough to let them direct. And always there's the struggle to raise money. ''You have endless dinners with men whom you convince yourself are interested in investing in your movie,'' says Karen Arthur, ''when all the time they're looking at your breasts. They evaporate when you suggest getting together with your lawyer.'' Sometimes the temptation to give up is overwhelming. Joelle Dobrow, a news and specials director, says, ''It's crisis time for me. If it doesn't happen in the next six years, it's all over. I'm not 22 anymore. I'm a director, it's all I know. What am I supposed to do, open a restaurant?'' Elaine May, the woman director with perhaps the most talent, has apparently given up directing films, because Polly Platt says, ''She did it for her personal life. This can be a very defeating town and at some point you have to say, what am I giving up for this?  The resource committee appointed by the Directors Guild to look into the plight of women in films had been scheduled to make its final report by last Oct. 8. The guild's national executive secretary, Michael H. Franklin, waited at the appointed time. Not one member of the committee showed up, nor were any apologies sent. A top executive at a major studio said that on the advice of a labor-relations lawyer it was decided that by taking part in this program the studio would be locking itself into voluntary mandates and putting itself in jeopardy. Lawyers for the Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers say that the resource committee was in trouble on several counts. The National Labor Relations Act prohibits the making of employment decisions on the basis of guild membership and the group met only with guild members. Also, by restricting their interview candidates women, says the A.M.P.T.P. lawyer, the resource committee was discriminating against other minorities in the guild. But it was clearly stated at the women's meeting with the producers that other minorities would be next, that this was simply the first in a series of such affirmative-action efforts. Unofficially, members of the producers' association complain that the guild is simply playing politics. ''They were facing the threat of suits from their own women members,'' says one lawyer. ''They're simply trying to protect their own rear ends by passing the buck to the producers.'' Nevertheless, an angry national board of the Directors Guild voted to file a complaint for discrimination against the production companies with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, which will hear the case on Jan. 19. It may do them little good, and it could produce a backlash. ''If a man has a woman forced on him,'' says 20th Century  vice president , ''he'll hate her. He'll want her to fail. And it will do more damage to women further down the line.'' The prospects for women directors are perhaps most promising for actresses who are interested in directing: people like Barbra Streisand, , Anne Bancroft (who made her directorial debut with ''Fatso''), Dyan Cannon, whose short film ''Number One'' was well received and was nominated for an Academy Award, and Lee Remick, who plans to direct her next film. These women could make it to a secure stephold because they have the visibility and clout that the others lack. They are accustomed to dealing with the power brokers, and they have the added advantage of being able to finance their efforts by their acting. ''I edited 'Tell Me a Rid-dle' while acting in 'Charlie Chan,''' says , ''and finished the mixing (while) doing 'The Fright' in Montreal. It's exhausting, but it works.'' Most reasonable people in the industry agree, however, that there simply hasn't been a sufficient body of work from any woman director to really tell who, if any, is likely to have staying power. Watching from the sidelines, Polly Platt, a production designer/producer who with her former husband, Peter Bogdanovitch, launched such successful films as ''The Last Picture Show'' and ''What's Up, Doc?'' says that, regrettably, she has not yet seen anyone she considers a really exciting talent among the ranks of women directors. ''But just to keep things in perspective,'' she says, ''don't forget that John Ford made (over 130) films, the first 45 of them were absolutely lousy. And Peter and I plowed through many of Hitchcock's efforts made in England. Most of (the very early ones) were quite dreadful.'' Fay Kanin is optimistic: ''If anyone had told me 10 years ago that there'd be so many women producers today, I wouldn't have believed it. It's just snowballed. I know it'll be harder for directors, but it will come. How much harder, is the question.  For every film that actually gets to the screen, there are 50 to 100 in development that never make it. That means it takes over 100 production executives to make about five films. Becoming a director, therefore, is approximately 20 times more competitive than being a producer. No wonder then, as Fay Kanin admits, ''It's going to be two steps forward and three back for a while, but it will come. Sherry says we'll get to the day when none of us will have 'woman' as (an automatic) prefix stuck in front of our title.'' For women directors that day can't come soon enough."
"NYT",2001,"France","WINE TALK; Pol Roger's Ambassador of Champagne","EVERY wine region of France has had its dynamic female executives. Philippine de Rothschild, at Chateau Mouton-Rothschild in Bordeaux, is a classic contemporary example. But Champagne country has been producing exceptional female leaders for almost two centuries. Odette Pol-Roger was perhaps the last of these Grandes Dames of Champagne. A popular figure in Paris society and a lifelong friend of Sir Winston Churchill, she died at 89 last Christmas Day at her home in Epernay, in the Champagne district. The first major figure among these women, and still the best known, was Nicole-Barbe Clicquot-Ponsardin, who took over the Clicquot Champagne house at the age of 27, following the death of her husband. She opened her own bank in Rheims when she was 44 and remained active in the business until shortly before her death in 1866, also at 89. The widow Clicquot has become immortalized as Veuve Clicquot, the label seen on one of the house's prestigious Champagnes. Mathilde Emile Laurent-Perrier ran Laurent-Perrier from 1858, after her husband's death, until 1890. The firm was later purchased by yet another Champagne veuve, Marie-Louise Lanson de Nonancourt, whose son, Bernard, brought it into prominence in the years after World War II. Louise Pommery ran Pommery & Greno from 1858 to 1890 and, more recently, Camille Olry-Roederer took over Champagne Louis Roederer in 1932 on the death of her husband. She died in 1974. Lily de Lauriston Bollinger took the helm of Bollinger on her husband's death in 1941 and remained active in the business until she died in 1977. Odette Pol-Roger never formally ran Pol Roger, but she was a director and played an active role in its management. After Churchill placed a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Paris on Nov. 11, 1944, he dined at the newly reopened British Embassy. The ambassador, Duff Cooper, and his wife, Diana, seated the prime minister beside Mme. Pol-Roger. He was so charmed by her that he told his hosts to invite her to dinner whenever he was in France.  Later that month, for his birthday, she sent him a case of his favorite Champagne, Pol Roger 1928. For the rest of Churchill's life, she sent him the 1928 Pol Roger on his birthday, until it ran out in 1953, and thereafter the 1934. She was invited to dine at Downing Street whenever she was in London. In 1952, Churchill named one of his racehorses Pol Roger, and brought Mme. Pol-Roger to England to watch the filly run. It eventually won four races, including the Black Prince Stakes Handicap on the day of Queen Elizabeth's coronation in 1953. Churchill never visited Mme. Pol-Roger's home at 44 Avenue de Champagne in Epernay, but he was fond of describing it as ""the world's most drinkable address."" When Churchill died in 1965, Mme. Pol-Roger was one of the personal friends asked to the funeral. The Pol-Roger family paid its respects by bordering in black all the bottles of its Champagne exported to Britain. In 1984, the Pol Roger company named its finest bottling Cuvee Winston Churchill, reserving the initial release for the British royal family and Churchill's descendants. Susan Mary Alsop, widow of the columnist Joseph Alsop, described the relationship between her friend Odette and Churchill to Cynthia Parzych and John Turner, authors of ""Pol Roger"" (Cynthia Parzych Publishing, 2000), a history of the Champagne house. It was, she said, ""a beautiful December-May relationship, quite harmless and smiled upon by Mrs. Churchill."" For Churchill, she said, ""Mme. Pol-Roger personified France, and he was a romantic about France."" Mme. Pol-Roger was the great-granddaughter of Sir Richard Wallace, a member of Parliament and a connoisseur whose vast art collection was left to the British government in 1897. Years later, when Odette Wallace and her two sisters, Jacqueline and Nicole, were reigning young beauties in Paris, they too were known as ""the Wallace collection."" Odette Wallace met Jacques Pol-Roger, the grandson of the founder of the Champagne house and later one of its partners, in Epernay while her father, a French Army general, was stationed there. She married in 1933 and soon became involved in the family business. ""When I was younger,"" she told an interviewer in later life, ""the smart Champagnes in Paris were Pommery and Clicquot. I set about getting Pol Roger in there."" She did it partly by discreetly urging friends in Paris society to serve Pol Roger at their daughters' weddings. Her firm was founded in 1849 by Pol Roger, Pol being another spelling for Paul. When he died in 1899, his sons, Maurice and Georges, changed their surname to Pol-Roger, using the hyphen. During World War II, the Pol-Rogers, like many Champagne families, cared for their neighbors and soldiers wounded in battle. Several times, Mme. Pol-Roger bicycled to Paris, a 12-hour trip, to carry messages for the Resistance. After her husband's death in 1964, she continued as a director of Pol Roger while devoting more time to gardening, decorating her homes in Epernay, Paris and Normandy, and to her favorite pastime, fly-fishing.

"WP",2004,"Iraq","Women In the New Iraq","My second trip to Iraq since the liberation of Baghdad grabbed some headlines because of a rocket attack on our hotel. But a visit to a new women's center in the city of Hillah said more about Iraq's future than did that act of violence. A predominantly Shiite town known as the site of one of Iraq's largest mass graves, where as many as 15,000 may have been killed, Hillah is also the location of something very hopeful, the Al Hillah Women's Center -- a center to advance the cause of women's rights. The women I met with were proud of their center. One young woman wearing a conservative Muslim head covering pressed me forcefully about what the United States was doing to support women's rights. In return, I asked if she saw any contradiction between her conservative dress and her advocacy of women's rights. With evident conviction, she said, ""There is no inconsistency between my practice of my religion and human rights and rights for women."" In such words we find the hope of a new Iraq. And in people like Rajaa Khuzai, a 57-year-old mother of seven and one of three women on the Iraq Governing Council. In 1991, when Saddam Hussein sent Republican Guards to put down a rebellion in her town of Diwaniya, Khuzai was the only doctor left functioning in her hospital. An obstetrician, she remembers performing more than 20 Caesareans working alone by candlelight. Today Khuzai remains undaunted by the challenges of helping give birth to freedom in a country that was abused for more than three decades by a regime of murderers and torturers. A few weeks ago a delegation of Iraqi women, led by Khuzai, visited the Pentagon -- there were doctors, engineers and teachers, Sunnis, Shiites and Chaldean/Assyrians, Arabs, Turkmen and Kurds. Khuzai has described her group as symbolic of the new ""one-nation"" Iraq. Some spoke about problems, others about the progress already made. What they had in common is that they are all working for a free and peaceful Iraq where they will have an equal voice. The delegation told us that if Iraq is to become a democracy, women must have an equal role and more women should be included in Iraqi governing bodies and ministries. They pointed out that only three of the 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council are women. They expressed the need to have women more directly involved in drafting the Iraqi constitution. They are concerned that if women are not involved, women will not be guaranteed equality under the law. They wanted Americans to know that Iraqis are grateful to be liberated from Hussein. And they also pointed out that we are now engaged with Iraqis in seeking a far greater prize: a chance for lasting change in the region that will help make our country and the world safer. History offers many examples of democratic principles at work in nations once dismissed by skeptics as unfit for democracy. Representative government, once thought impossible in Eastern Europe, is taking hold, though slowly in some places. In a country where only a few years ago women were brutalized and shunted from public view, Afghans recently adopted a constitution that establishes equal rights for men and women. Democracy, they once said, was impossible in most of East Asia. Only 20 years ago, when I became assistant secretary of state for East Asia, people said that Koreans had no experience of democracy and would be incapable of it. Or that the Philippines could never do better than the dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos. The Confucian culture of East Asia was said to be antithetical to democracy. Yet, in the past 20 years, not only South Korea and the Philippines but Taiwan, Thailand and Indonesia have joined the democratic ranks. While each of these Asian democracies still faces challenges, each has made substantial progress. In the end, it will be up to Iraqis to fashion a democracy that suits their circumstances. One of the critical tests of an Iraqi democracy will be whether it empowers women to enjoy the benefits of freedom and prosperity without sacrificing their religious faith. This is an issue that concerns everyone, not only women. A government that does not respect the rights of half its citizens cannot be trusted to safeguard the rights of any. For that reason, the United States is giving special emphasis to helping Iraqi women achieve greater equality and has allocated $27 million for women's programs. Education for women is one of the highest priorities, and the United States has committed more than $86.8 million to education projects, with special emphasis on ensuring that girls are registered and attending school. Another effort is focused on legal reform. Substantial funding is also going to help women's groups throughout the country, including the center in Hillah. There are now 10 women's centers throughout the country and eight more are in the works. And with U.S. support, Iraqi women are being trained for the first time to serve as police officers, prison guards and security officers. These efforts are strongly supported by the legislative branch. Reps. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) and Tom Osborne (R-Neb.), who recently visited Iraq, have begun to organize a congressional caucus for Iraqi women to maintain effort and focus in this critical area. And these efforts are strongly supported by President Bush, who has said our aim is ""a peace founded upon the dignity and rights of every man and woman."" It was clear that day in Hillah that the women were eager to be full participants in Iraq's democratic process. I gave them this challenge: I said that some people in this world say that Arabs can't build democracy. As I looked at the brave people of Hillah, men and women who'd already begun to find their voice, I added that I believe that is nonsense. ""You have a chance,"" I said, ""to prove them wrong. So please do it."" And we should do everything we can to help them.

"NYT",2006,"Syria","Women Lead an Islamic Revival In Syria, Testing Its Secularism","Enas al-Kaldi stops in the hallway of her Islamic school for girls and coaxes her 6-year-old schoolmate through a short recitation from the Koran. ''It's true that they don't understand what they are memorizing at this age, but we believe that the understanding comes when the Koran becomes part of you,'' Ms. Kaldi, 16, said proudly. In other corners of Damascus, women who identify one another by the distinctive way they tie their head scarves gather for meetings of an exclusive and secret Islamic women's society known as the Qubaisiate. At those meetings, participants say, they are tutored further in the faith and are even taught how to influence some of their well-connected fathers and husbands to accept a greater presence of Islam in public life. These are the two faces of an Islamic revival for women in Syria, one that could add up to a potent challenge to this determinedly secular state. Though government officials vociferously deny it, Syria is becoming increasingly religious and its national identity is weakening. If Islam replaces that identity, it may undermine the unity of a society that is ruled by a Muslim religious minority, the Alawites, and includes many religious groups. Syrian officials, who had front-row seats as Hezbollah dragged Lebanon into war, are painfully aware of the myriad ways that state authority can be undermined by increasingly powerful, and appealing, religious groups. Though Syria's government supports Hezbollah, it has been taking steps to ensure that the phenomenon it helped to build in Lebanon does not come to haunt it at home. In the past, said Muhammad al-Habash, a Syrian lawmaker who is also a Muslim cleric, ''we were told that we had to leave Islam behind to find our futures.'' ''But these days,'' he said, ''if you ask most people in Syria about their history, they will tell you, 'My history is Islamic history.' The younger generation are all reading the Koran.'' Women are in the vanguard. Though men across the Islamic world usually interpret Scripture and lead prayers, Syria, virtually alone in the Arab world, is seeing the resurrection of a centuries-old tradition of sheikhas, or women who are religious scholars. The growth of girls' madrasas has outpaced those for boys, religious teachers here say. There are no official statistics about precisely how many of the country's 700 madrasas are for girls. But according to a survey of Islamic education in Syria published by the pan-Arab daily Al Hayat, there are about 80 such madrasas in Damascus alone, serving more than 75,000 women and girls, and about half are affiliated with the Qubaisiate (pronounced koo-BAY-see-AHT). For many years any kind of religious piety was viewed here with skepticism. But while men suspected of Islamist activity are frequently interrogated and jailed, subjecting women to such treatment would cause a public outcry that the government cannot risk. Women have taken advantage of their relatively greater freedom to form Islamic groups, becoming a deeply rooted and potentially subversive force to spread stricter and more conservative Islamic practices in their families and communities. Since intelligence agents still monitor private gatherings that involve discussion of Islam, groups like the Qubaisiate often meet clandestinely, sometimes with women guarding the door to deter interlopers. The group is named for its founder, a charismatic Syrian sheikha, Munira al-Qubaisi. A wealthy woman in her 50's living in Damascus, who has attended Qubaisiate meetings and who asked that her name not be used because she feared punishment, provided a rough description of the activities. A girl thought to be serious about her faith may be invited by a relative or a school friend to go to a meeting, the woman said. There, a sheikha sits on a raised platform, addresses the assembled women on religious subjects and takes questions. Qubaisiate members, the woman said, tie their head scarves so there is a puff of fabric under the chin, like a wattle. As girls and women progress in their study of Islam and gain stature within the group, the color of their scarves changes. New members wear white ones, usually with long khaki colored coats, she said. Later they graduate to wearing navy blue scarves with a navy coat. At the final stage the sheikha may grant them permission to cover themselves completely in black. Hadeel, a Syrian woman in her early 20's who asked to be identified only by her first name, described how her best childhood friend had become one of the Qubaisi ''sisterhood'' and encouraged her to follow suit. ''Rasha would call and say, 'Today we're going shopping,' and that would be a secret code meaning that there was a lesson at 7:30,'' Hadeel said. ''I went three times, and it was amazing. They had all this expensive food, just for teenage girls, before the lesson. And they had fancy Mercedes cars to take you back home afterward.'' Hadeel said she had at first been astonished by the way the Qubaisiate, ostensibly a women's prayer group, seemed to single out the daughters of wealthy and influential families and girls who were seen as potential leaders. ''They care about getting girls with big names, the powerful families,'' Hadeel said. ''In my case, they wanted me because I was a good student.'' Women speaking about the group asked that their names not be used because the group is technically illegal, though it seems the authorities are increasingly turning a blind eye. ''To be asked to join the Qubaisiate is very prestigious,'' said Maan Abdul Salam, a women's rights campaigner. Mr. Abdul Salam explained that such secret Islamic prayer groups recruited women differently, depending on their social position. ''They teach poor women how to humble themselves in front of their husbands and how to pray, but they're teaching upper-class women how to influence politics,'' he said. The Islamic school where Ms. Kaldi, the 16-year-old tutor, studies has no overt political agenda. But it is a place where devotion to Islam, and an exploration of women's place in it, flourishes. The school, at the Zahra mosque in a western suburb of Damascus, is a cheerful, cozy place, with soft Oriental carpets layered underfoot and scores of little girls running around in their socks. Ms. Kaldi spends summers, vacations and some afternoons there, studying and helping younger children to memorize the Koran. Her work tutoring has made her an important figure in this world; many of the younger girls greet her shyly as they pass. The school accepts girls as young as 5, who begin memorizing the Koran from the back, where the shortest verses are found. The youngest girls are being taught with the aid of hand gestures, games and treats. The atmosphere is relaxed. The children share candy and snacks as they study, and the room hums with the sound of high-pitched voices reciting in unison. Several girls, preparing for the tests that will allow them to progress to higher-level classes, swing one-handed around the smooth columns that support the roof of the mosque, dreamily murmuring verses aloud to themselves. After girls in the Zahra school have committed the Koran to memory, they are taught to recite the holy book with the prescribed rhythm and cadences, a process called tajweed, which usually takes at least several years of devoted study. Along the way they are taught the principles of Koranic reasoning. It is this art of Koranic reasoning, Ms. Kaldi and her friends say, that most sets them apart from previous generations of Syrian Muslim women. Fatima Ghayeh, 16, an aspiring graphic designer and Ms. Kaldi's best friend, said she believed that ''the older generation,'' by which she meant women now in their late 20's and their 30's, too often allowed their fathers and husbands to dictate their faith to them. They came of age before the Islamic revivalist movement that has swept Syria, she explained, and as a result many of them do not feel an intellectual ownership of Islamic teaching in the way that their younger sisters do. ''The older girls were told, 'This is Islam, and so you should do this,' '' Ms. Ghayeh said. ''They feel that they can't really ask questions. ''It's because 10 years ago Syria was really closed, and there weren't so many Islamic schools. But society has really changed. Today girls are saying, 'We want to do something with Islam, and for Islam.' We're more active, and we ask questions.'' Ms. Ghayeh and Ms. Kaldi each remember with emotion the day, early in President Bashar al-Assad's tenure, when he changed the law to allow the wearing of Islamic head scarves in public schools, a practice that was forbidden under his father, Hafez al-Assad. The current president, who took office in 2000, also reduced the hours that students must spend each week in classes where the ruling Baath Party's ideology is taught, and began allowing soldiers to pray in mosques. Those changes have been popular among Sunnis, who make up 70 percent of the country's population, but they carry political risks for a government that has long been allergic to public displays of religious fervor. The government has been eager to demonstrate in recent years, through changes like these and increasing references to Syria's Islamic heritage in official speeches, that it does not fear Islam as such. During the weeks of war between Israel and Hezbollah, the government frequently used references to the Islamic cause and to the ''Lebanese resistance,'' as Hezbollah is called in the Syrian state-controlled news media, to play to the feelings of Syrians and consolidate its support. But it is still deeply anxious about Islamic groups acting outside the apparatus of the state, and the threat that they may lose to state control. The girls at the madrasa say that by plunging more deeply into their faith, they learn to understand their rights within Islam. In upper-level courses at the Zahra school, the girls debate questions like whether a woman has the right to vote differently from her husband. The question is moot in Syria, one classmate joked, because President Assad inevitably wins elections by a miraculous 99 percent, just as his father did before him. When the occasion arises, they say, they are able to reason from the Koran on an equal footing with men. ''People mistake tradition for religion,'' Ms. Kaldi said. ''Men are always saying, 'Women can't do that because of religion,' when in fact it is only tradition. It's important for us to study so that we will know the difference.''","Enas al- stops in the hallway of her Islamic school for girls and coaxes her 6-year-old schoolmate through a short recitation from the Koran.

The government has been eager to demonstrate in recent years, through changes like these and increasing references to 's Islamic heritage in official speeches, that it does not fear Islam as such. During the weeks of war between  and , the government frequently used references to the Islamic cause and to the '' resistance,'' as  is called in the n state-controlled news media, to play to the feelings of ns and consolidate its support. But it is still deeply anxious about Islamic groups acting outside the apparatus of the state, and the threat that they may lose to state control. The girls at the madrasa say that by plunging more deeply into their faith, they learn to understand their rights within Islam. In upper-level courses at the  school, the girls debate questions like whether a woman has the right to vote differently from her husband. The question is moot in , one classmate joked, because President  inevitably wins elections by a miraculous 99 percent, just as his father did before him. When the occasion arises, they say, they are able to reason from the Koran on an equal footing with men. ''People mistake tradition for religion,'' Ms.  said. ''Men are always saying, 'Women can't do that because of religion,' when in fact it is only tradition. It's important for us to study so that we will know the difference.''"
"WP",1991,"Iraq","Women on the Battlefield; Gulf War Role Helps Bring Shift in Attitude","As Army Lt. Col. Roslyn Goff prepared to lead 800 soldiers through Iraqi minefields and into the battlefields of Kuwait and Iraq last February, some of her male troops were almost as apprehensive about their commander as they were about enemy weapons. ""Is this woman really going to take us into battle?"" Goff said some of the men under her command in the support battalion were asking themselves. ""We thought we were going to be shot at, artillery was going to fall on us and we were going to be nuked and chemmed."" But any fears about her leadership proved unfounded. Instead, Goff was awarded the Bronze Star after the war. A military that technically bars women from serving in combat jobs said the 41-year-old Goff ""inspired her battalion to excellence under fire."" Performances such as Goff's during the Persian Gulf War have become catalysts for the most dramatic recommendations in decades aimed at opening new jobs to women in the military services. More than any other event in modern history, the gulf war -- in which five women died in combat, two were taken prisoner of war and 33,000 served, constituting 6 percent of U.S. forces in the region -- has prompted even some ardent conservatives in Congress and the Bush administration to consider lifting restrictions that have prevented women from attaining some of the most prestigious jobs in the armed forces. But the war also has hardened the resolve of many senior military officials who believe that expanding the roles of women to infantry units and other direct-combat jobs would disrupt the cohesion of fighting forces and could compromise readiness of the U.S. military. ""By inserting women into those types of units, with our physiological differences, you can build uncertainties and distrust and competition for the ladies -- the male in competition for the female,"" said Lt. Gen. Norman H. Smith, chief of manpower for the Marine Corps. ""It could have a tendency to break down those highly trained, tough, mission-assigned units."" Smith and other military commanders also say few women have the physical strength to serve in many ground combat jobs. Some opponents of the move have charged that permitting women in combat jobs would be the first step toward including women in any future military draft, although proponents point out that there is no relationship between the two issues in law or military regulation. Nevertheless, stunning even the most determined proponents of a wider role for women in the military, the House -- with virtually no debate -- recently approved legislation giving the services the authority to open to women all aircraft jobs, from fighter pilots to bomber navigators. More startling still, Defense Secretary Richard B. Cheney endorsed the proposal. ""One of the lessons we've learned from Operation Desert Storm is the extent to which the nation accepted the significant role of women in that operation,"" said Pete Williams, Cheney's chief spokesman. ""Until then, there had always been a concern that having women involved in combat would be traumatic for the country."" ""Who can take to the floor and say we must keep the combat-exclusion [laws] because this is how we keep women out of harm's way?"" said Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.), a long-time advocate of opening more jobs to women. ""They saw how artificial all that was -- the idea that you don't want women killed and you don't want women prisoners. We had some of those,"" she said. On Tuesday, the Senate Armed Services Committee's manpower and personnel panel will conduct a hearing on the issues that senators say will be pivotal to the Senate's decision to support -- or perhaps expand -- the House-passed recommendation. Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and William V. Roth Jr. (R-Del.) are taking the lead in pushing legislation to open the combat aviation jobs to women. The Defense Advisory Committee on Women in the Services, a panel appointed by the secretary of defense, sensed the shift in attitudes toward changing the laws and proposed at its spring meeting that Congress consider abolishing the entire combat-exclusion law. While Cheney's relatively quick endorsement of the legislation has stymied much public debate in the Pentagon, military officials are privately fuming and fretting. The issue, they realize, involves far more than opening combat cockpits to women. It could likely be the first link to fall in a chain of traditionally protected jobs in the military, from aircraft carriers to infantry units. ""It's going to be hard to defend not doing a total repeal of the combat-exclusion law,"" one senior Army official said. ""You've taken the heart and soul out of the law."" The Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps now operate under a 1948 law that bars women from serving in jobs considered ""direct combat."" The Army is governed by internal regulations that are based on the same criteria as the law. The laws and policies were modified by the Defense Department in 1988 to say that the ""risk of direct combat, exposure to hostile fire or capture are proper criteria for closing positions to women."" Under that definition, women are allowed to serve in logistical support units, fly refueling tankers and work aboard naval supply and repair ships. Those jobs are considered less risky than positions in infantry units, fighter planes or Navy destroyers. ""The face of war has changed significantly, while our assignment policies for women have been resistant to change due to what may be antiquated legal restrictions,"" Sen. John W. Warner (R-Va.), a former secretary of the Navy, wrote Cheney shortly after the gulf war ended. ""Unfortunately, the evolution of warfighting technology on land and at sea has greatly reduced the security of all areas,"" he said. Sgt. Tammy Garcia, 24, of the Army Military Police, said she frequently found herself ""pulling duty"" with forward-deployed combat troops in Saudi Arabia. ""I was right there with the line units following behind them on the front line,"" she said. The Marine Corps and Army are fearful the Senate will abolish the combat-exclusion laws, opening infantry, artillery and armor positions to women. The Navy is worried that opening combat pilot jobs to women will force them to allow women to serve on aircraft carriers and other combatant vessels that support those planes. The Air Force, with a little internal grumbling, appears the most willing to accept the changes. Air Force Lt. Gen. Thomas J. Hickey, deputy chief of staff for personnel, told the Senate Armed Services Committee this spring that ""the last impediment"" to allowing women to fly combat aircraft is the combat-exclusion law. He added that Air Force officials believe there ""is not a mission -- including fighter pilots and pulling 9 Gs -- in the U.S. Air Force that women are not physically and mentally capable of performing."" In the other services, civilian military leaders seem generally more receptive to opening more jobs to women than military counterparts. ""My recommendaton at this juncture would be that women should not fly in combat,"" Lt. Gen. Gordon Sullivan, President Bush's nominee to become Army chief of staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee during his confirmation hearing last week. But in a published interview last month, Army Secretary Michael P.W. Stone said that if Congress approves the legislation allowing women to serve in all aircraft, the Army ""would follow that guidance and open that part of the aviation branch that is presently restricted."" Many service officials have resigned themselves to the prospect of radical changes. Lt. Gen. Carl Mundy, Bush's choice for commandant of the Marine Corps, said during his nominaton hearing last week that he believes women can fly planes superbly, but that his reservation would be making room for female pilots on ships that frequently require pilots to share small, cramped compartments. But the politically sensitive Mundy added, ""If told to do it, the Marine Corps knows how to salute."" Even if Congress lifts some or all legal restrictions on jobs women may hold, it would be left up to the secretary of defense or the military services to decide whether to make the change. Some of the changes could require several years to implement because of training necessities and the need to reconfigure living accommodations for sailors aboard ships. Many women say, however, they would be relucant to serve in direct-combat jobs. ""Most of the women out here don't want to play a combat role,"" said Sgt. Ethel Kelsaw, a 25-year-old Army communications specialist from Fargo, Ga., who is a five-month gulf veteran. ""We like to do our part, but we don't want to go up front. That's a male's job. We don't want to go up there and get killed,"" she said. But Lt. Col. Kelly Hamilton, who flew KC-135 refueling tankers for the Air Force during the war, disagreed. Under current law, she said, ""I can get shot at; I just can't shoot back."" Special correspondent John Arundel in Kuwait contributed to this report.","As  Lt.

"WP",2004,"Iraq","Women's Rights Rally","Thousands of women's rights advocates gathered in Washington today for a march advocating safe abortions, birth control and sex education for women worldwide, and opponents of abortion also staged protests near the Mall. Washington Post reporters here chronicle some of the activities of the day. A Different Era for Steinem As the march rounded onto Constitution Avenue, there was Gloria Steinem about 10 paces back from the crowded, sweating front lines. No longer the official leader of an organization, freed from the pressure of being behind the front banner, Steinem carried no sign, only a petite leather backpack and a tan leather jacket tied around her slim waist. ""We've never had a secretary of state in our front line before,"" she noted, gesturing ahead toward Madeleine Albright. Then she glanced around her, smiling at the chanting. She pumped her fist a few times, silver jewelry jangling, then brought it almost self-consciously down. Occasionally a young woman would dart up and shake her hand or an older one would ask for an autograph or tell her -- still glamorous and long-haired -- ""You look fabulous."" But mostly she seemed reflective. Then the chants started again, the young women surged forward and as a reporter passed, a woman said, ""You've talked to her enough."" Yet at that moment, there was nobody else there. -- Elizabeth Williamson, 3:15 p.m. A ""Die-In"" With dozens of police officers looking on, about 60 antiabortion demonstrators laid down in the middle of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue as part of a ""die-in"" an hour before the main march passed through. As the protesters began to draw figures of children in chalk on the street -- a symbolic nod to the age old police practice of outlining homicide victims -- D.C. Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey took in the scene. ""The good thing about this ""die-in,"" Ramsey told a top aide, ""is that it doesn't go against my homicide count."" -- Del Quentin Wilber, 3 p.m. Young and Old Drawn to Rally Teddi Berkowitz, 66, from Stamford, Conn., was picnicking on the Mall as the tail of the march moved away from her. She said her three middle-aged children and six grandchildren were proof that she is not pro-abortion. But she said, ""I'm for choice."" ""There's no place for politics when it comes to choice. There's no place for religion when it comes to choice,"" she said. ""The only place for choice is in your heart."" Marcie Echeverria, 41, of Palisades, N.J., came to the march with two generations of women in her family, her mother and 4-year-old daughter, Isabel. ""My daughter's here for what?"" ""Choice!"" Isabel responded. -- Clarence Williams, 2:30 p.m. A Tedious Chore The procession of marchers shuffled one head behind the other as they blindly walked toward RFK Stadium in the hope of finding a Metro stop. At the entrance to the dark pedestrian tunnel outside parking lot number 7, a friendly beacon told them the way. > ""Good morning, everybody. Glad you could make it,"" volunteer Cindy Lewis said with a smile. ""When you go through here, you're going to the top of the stairs. When you cross the street, the Armory is on the left. That is your Metro stop,"" the volunteer said still smiling. An occasional ""Where you from,"" was interjected in her refrain which repeated minute after minute after minute. Finally Lewis needed a break. After 3 1/2 hours she exhaled a tired ""harrumph"" and perched on a concrete slab. ""Boy I'm tired of saying that."" -- Clarence Williams, 2:30 p.m. College Students Join In Thousands of students came to the rally and march from colleges across the country -- Colby College in Maine, the University of Pennsylvania, Ohio's Oberlin College, and tiny Earlham College, in Richmond, Indiana. About 40 Earlham students rode all night in vans to get to the rally. Several dozen undergraduates from Colby College made a similar trip by bus. The students said women's reproductive rights still seemed fragile to them, even though they were born a decade or more after the 1973 Roe v. Wade Supreme Court decision that established a woman's right to abortion. Lili Birnbaum, 19, a Colby student from Newton, Mass., said she was marching to demand safe and affordable birth control, quality health and sex education for girls, and full access to abortion. ""I have friends who had to go to New Hampshire in high school to get abortions,"" to avoid the parental notification law in Massachusetts, she said. -- Debbi Wilgoren, 2:15 p.m. Can You Find Me Now? So many of the people at the march were using cellular phones that it was often hard to get a signal. Whitney Brimfield, 27, of Baltimore, sent a text message on her phone to a friend who was also on the Mall, hoping they would find each other in the crowd. Walking in front of her, Josh Meyer, 27, of Cambridge, used his cell phone to try to pinpoint the whereabouts of his 19-year-old sister. ""Are you in front of the Washington Monument,"" he asked Toby Meyer just after 1 p.m., striding in that direction from 7th Street N.W. Behind him, Brimfield laughed. ""Everyone's in front of the Washington Monument,"" she said. But Meyer, ever the big brother, persisted. ""Okay, you're in front of it. To the right or the left,"" he asked patiently. ""Okay, I know where you are,"" he said after a couple more exchanges. We'll try to make it up there."" -- Debbi Wilgoren, 2:15 p.m. ""They Don't Have a Clue"" Jackie Miller of Alexandria was standing in the middle of 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW holding a picture of a 5-month-old fetus when suddenly she was forced into the middle of a group of abortion rights marchers and dragged nearly a half block. ""They grabbed me and pulled me in,"" said Miller, 57. ""They locked their arms around me and they took my sign,"" said Miller, who is a nurse, as she came back over to join her fellow anti-abortion protesters. She recalls 31 years ago when she was in nursing school holding a six-week-old fetus that had been miscarried and brought to the hospital in Americus, Ga., where she was working. She said it was two and a half inches long and it was definitely a male. ""It was a human being and it was visible at six weeks. These people don't understand the reality of what's going on. They don't have a clue. A human entity is formed early on and it's not part of a mother's body,"" she said. When Miller, who said she was not afraid of the women who held her in their circle, broke loose they had forced a pro-choice sign in her hands. She threw it down on the ground. Kathy Maxwell of Roselle, N.J., agrees with Miller. She came to the march with about 80 people from New Calvary Baptist Church of Montclair, N.J. She said she remembers when she first got pregnant five years ago as a unmarried 20-year-old college freshman and had to tell her parents. Her parents were very disappointed -- her mother asked her if she had thought about getting an abortion and her father threatened to put her out of their home. But Maxwell said she never second-guessed her decision to continue her pregnancy. ""I kept faithful and prayerful,"" she said. Today Maxwell and her 5-year-old son, Christopher, with her along the march route. She's married to his father and is expecting another baby in October. Although she is working and goes to school, Maxwell said she would never dream of not having her baby. ""I think it would be selfish to say 'I have all these things going on in my life, I am going to kill this baby.' '' -- Yolanda Woodlee, 2 p.m.  Finding a Parking Spot Police had closed 14th Street to traffic, but 65-year-old George Trent of Annandale had no problem driving his fire-engine-red Lamborghini look-alike over the bridge and midway across the Mall. At 10:29 am, he parked behind the only other vehicle on the street, a car used to ferry march VIPs. Trent and his 10-year-old granddaughter, Kassandra Trent, disembarked and found themselves due east of the Washington Monument, directly behind the stage where the pre-march rally was in full swing. ""They usually let me park,"" Trent said. ""They see 'Lamborghini' written on it, they think you're a millionaire."" In fact, Trent is a working man, an information technology specialist with the General Services Administration. The vehicle he calls his ""dream car"" is actually a replica of a 1986 Lamborghini. It cost close to $50,000, Trent said, about half the price of the real thing. But that didn't stop scores of rally goers from gawking and staring, whipping out their cameras to immortalize this bit of luxury amidst the marchers, banners and signs. -- Debbi Wilgoren, 12:30 p.m.  Howard Dean Sighting Former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean caused a small ripple of excitement as he hurried west on Jefferson Drive toward the rally stage just before noon, trailed by a few aides. Rallygoers rushed to Dean, who was wearing a white shirt and a burgundy tie to shake his hand, snap his picture or wish him well. ""All right, Howard Dean! Way to go,"" shouted Marcy Bernstein, 60, of Stamford, Conn., jumping up and down as she saw him. Bernstein said she came to the rally with a group from her synagogue, Greenwich Reform Synagogue. She had also attended the last major abortion rights gathering, in Washington in 1992. She came, she said, out of concern for her daughters -- both of whom stayed away to study for their college finals. She came, she said, so they would never have to face the choices she did, when she had an illegal abortion in the 1960s. ""Nobody should have to go through that,"" she said. -- Debbi Wilgoren, 12:30 p.m. A Sign Is Important ""I want 'Pro-choice, Pro-child,'"" Roberta Blumberg, 53, told the volunteers handing out signs at 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue NW today at about 9:30 a.m. She was already juggling two yellow and blue ""Who decides?"" signs attached to hollow cardboard tubes, but she wanted one with a ""pro-child"" statement. On a day with a multitude of messages, picking exactly the right combination was critical. So she took the ""Who decides?"" placard on one side and attached it to a ""Pro-child"" sign on a stick. ""Could you staple this one over here please,"" Blumberg, a registered nurse who came to the march with seven friends from Raleigh, N.C., asked a volunteer. ""Oh wait a minute, excuse me,"" she called to a woman passing by who had mistakenly taken her sign. That was her sign. -- Manny Fernandez, 11:30 a.m.  In Search of a Button It wasn't the abortion issue that drew Al Feldstein, his wife and a daughter to the Mall -- it was a much smaller issue. About the size of a half dollar to be exact. Feldstein, 54, of LaVale, Md., has been collecting protest and presidential campaign buttons since 1967, and his collection over the years has grown to nearly 10,000. He keeps thousands of these on display behind glass cases at home -- little footnotes of modern American history lining the walls of his den. Feldstein who works for the Maryland Department of Planning and describes his button collecting as a hobby, walked on the gravel of the Mall around 10 a.m. He wore 13 buttons on his green polo shirt. ""Excuse me,"" he said, approaching a woman who was wearing a ""Mothers Opposing Bush"" button, ""do you have one you can sell?"" Bingo. It was a few steps later when he saw a woman wearing dozens of buttons on her skirt and hat. A rival. ""I started in '67,"" he told the woman. The woman said she started in '70. ""Did you get one of these?"" he asked, pulling out his ""Mothers Opposing Bush"" button from his pocket. ""Yup."" -- Manny Fernandez, 11:30 a.m. Women Executives at Washington's Biggest Companies  Jill Dutt, the assistant managing editor for business, will be online to talk about her http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40173-2004Apr25.html feature profiles of nearly two dozen women executives at some of the Washington area's biggest companies and http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40143-2004Apr25.html her article on ten of Marriott International's top female executives. Both pieces are tied to the annual http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/business/localbusiness/top200 Post 200 ranking of the region's top companies. Jill Dutt discusses her story and the Post 200. Editor's Note: Washingtonpost.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. For your Post 200 articles, you spoke to numerous female executives in the Washington region. Were there any themes you came across? Jill Dutt: Every executive was unique, but I was struck in all my interviews with how the women all credited their teams for having been the key to their success. It was true for many of them that building coalitions around their ideas was more successful than top-down, my-way-or-the-highway orders. Being a lawyer or a technology specialist also played central roles in these women being seen and recognized, as those jobs gave them exposure to the executive suite. Washington, D.C.: What do you recommend to women who work for companies that are dominated by men who are uncomfortable working with women? Should they press on at the company or move on. Jill Dutt: Press on, of course! If you aren't being recognized or paid appropriately for the work you do, seek out people within the company who will champion your efforts. If there's no one there to do that, then benchmark your pay and performance with professionals at similar companies and present those results to your boss. If you still get the short end of the stick, then you probably should move on. It will be their loss and you'll know that for your colleagues and our daughters that you gave it your best shot. Vienna, Va.: What did the executives you interviewed say about what was lacking in the Washington area that could have helped them move forward either faster or further by this point in their career? Jill Dutt: There seems to be a lack of critical mass here of truly corporate women. Perhaps because the region is focused so intently on politics, government and advocacy organizations--and not so much on bottom-line, money-making enterprises--smart, talented corporate women can get overlooked. But, as several women said, the Washington area is a land of transients and so people in power are open to new blood coming in and that can be helpful to women. Washington, D.C.: So why didn't Deborah Kissire create her network? Not enough interest? Are female executives here not as driven as their New York City counterparts? Jill Dutt: My sense is women here are as driven as anywhere. Certainly every one of the executives I interviewed were driven. The difference between New York and Washington, one of the many differences, I think, is that New York is driven by making money and Washington is driven more by causes, by policy, by big ideas for shaping the world. Deborah didn't think her specific idea of a day-long program targeted to the issues facing C-level women would get enough attendance here. But that probably has to do more with a lack of critical mass than the passion, smarts or ambitions of Washington-area women executives. Silver Spring, Md.: Do you have suggestions for finding mentors and networking? During my 10-year career, I found it really hard to make connections with people in a business environment. Jill Dutt: Just ask someone you really admire, someone you think can teach you something. She (or he) will likely be flattered that you recognize they have something others can learn from. Be sure to ask people not just because they're powerful and you calculate that they can help you get ahead. People will sense that ungenuine interest in their guidance. Washington, D.C.: It seems like there are many more high-level women at the region's non-profit organizations. Why the discrepancy? Jill Dutt: I didn't interview the many dozens of powerful women at the region's non-profits. I think passionate women who have leadership material may be drawn to causes more than they're drawn to making a lot of money. But that is just an assumption on my part. You've given me an idea for a follow up article! Boston, Mass.: In your experience, would you say some industries or types of business (small, large, privat, public) are more female friendly than others? Could you name 5 top industries, professions that are invested in the promotion of women and 5 that aren't? Jill Dutt: Well, I have to admit I was surprised to find top women executives and board members of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. But perhaps I shouldn't have been, since in talking to folks there, they recognize that their customers--increasingly high-level women in government--are becoming more diverse. The women I interviewed came from a vast array of industries and all seemed to have found their way to a top spot. Washington, D.C.: Of the two dozen you interviewed, what did these women have in common?And what did you find to be the biggest obstacle for women, specifically in this region? Jill Dutt: The women all seemed to have focused on their work, not networking. They are results-oriented. So many of them had been put in charge of projects to undertake major structural change inside their organizations and succeeded. I wondered if that skill has something to do with the idea that women can juggle lots of responsibilities and keep their center, set their priorities to get the job done. Perhaps it's also because those jobs appear unglamorous and non-threatening that women got the assignments in the first place. And then their coalition-building skills got them through the enormous challenge of actually implementing change. Those assignments get the attention and interest of top-level executives and a company's board, so they really seemed to be a place women could prove themselves. As for the biggest obstacle, I think it may be time. Many of the women experienced gender discrimination early in their careers, coming into professional corporate assignments in the 1970s. Those incidents might have knocked 5 or 10 years off their growth trajectory, but none were so egregious that it knocked them off-track. Washington, D.C.: You mentioned that having a background as a lawyer or technical specialist played a role in the success of these women, do you think that it has something with the training that they received in those areas? Jill Dutt: Yes. In law, the process of having to think clearly and present logical, persuasive argument certainly helped some of these women speak the same language as the men in the room. As for technology, there, too, understanding how a system works and how it can be used to make a task more efficient helped several women. Also, because the tech field grew up at the same time these women did, there were fewer barriers to entry and they were able to increase their roles within companies at the same time the technology they were running became more robust and pervasive. Washington, D.C.: Did the women that you interviewed indicate whether it is more beneficial to have a female mentor or male mentor or just a mentor? I am wondering if the idea is to adopt a more male approach to business or if there's a way to leverage characteristics/style of a woman. And, if so, then what is that style? Jill Dutt: Gail Steinel at BearingPoint spoke eloquently about this in our interview. I wish I'd had more space to include her comments in the article! She and I were talking about an article in this month's Harvard Business Review, entitled, ""Do Women Lack Ambition?"" We agreed that women only lacked the kind of ""ambition"" that is defined by men (speaking in generalities here, of course). Gail said early in her career she didn't realize that she was supposed to act differently because she was a woman; her parents had always told her she could do anything she set out to do (and she's proven them right). That said, she has learned in some ways to change her language in discussions, but she says she hasn't changed her management style. For example, when she has a feeling that a given course of action is the right one for a company to take, she says she doesn't use the word ""feelings"" in discussing it with men. She uses terms like ""gut instincts."" She says men respect that, but they almost visibly back away when the word ""feelings"" comes up. So, it's like Deborah Tannen says, even though men and women might be sensing the same thing, because they tend to use different language to get it across, misunderstandings can occur. Laura Paugh at Marriott talked about how, in this era when businesses need to collaborate with one another, not just compete, a woman's style of management seems to be more effective. Championing collaboration is one way to leverage the characteristic shared by many women. Fairfax, Va.: One of the things I've noticed about women who rise to the top is that they seem to have no trouble speaking their minds and standing up for themselves...yet, as junior-level employees, assertive women are often labeled as ""difficult,"" or ""aggressive,"" or any one of a number of unpleasant adjectives. I've noticed that men who share these same qualities are often rewarded for them, while women are punished by being passed over for promotions etc. Did these top women offer any strategies for dealing with this situation? Jill Dutt: Yes. Especially early in your career, when you need to speak your mind, make sure you have facts and data to back you up. It's just like that story MCI's Cindy Andreotti told. She knew ATT could come up with the technology product that would sell big--touch-screen bridal registry purchases--but none of the men in charge thought it would be profitable. She did the research and legwork to outline the whole technology piece that needed to get done, the marketing piece, the business plan, etc., and was so convincing (and right!) that no one could dismiss her as simply being ""difficult."" Catherine West at Capital One talked about being disarming and unchallenging in tone and style as being helpful to her in her career. You don't have to shout if you have command of your brief and can be quietly persuasive. Washington D.C.: Your article seem to exclude women in local government in very high positions, for example Suzanne Peck Chief Technology Officer for the District of Columbia. Jill Dutt: Yes. I only focused on women at companies that have more than $1 billion in annual revenue. The Post has done many stories about high-level women in government, politics and the media. I wanted to focus on a specific sliver: the women who hang in at the world's largest corporations and climb their way to the top. That's not to take away anything from the prodigious accomplishments of women like Suzanne. She is certainly formidable and, if she wanted to, could probably run her own company. Washington, D.C.: Were any of the women minorities as well#63; Jill Dutt: Yes. Linda Gooden at Lockheed, Beverly Perry at Pepco and Beverly Burke at Washington Gas immediately come to mind. Fairfax, Va.: As a female CEO and recently transplanted Texan, I have discovered there are many networking opportunities in the Washington, D.C. area, however, there appear to be few networking organizations or opportunities for C-level executives. Are there any you can recommend? Jill Dutt: The only one I know about is the Committee of 200. The National Association of Women Business Owners also has networking groups. Germantown, Md.: Do you think Deborah Kissire would be interested in trying again to recreate her networking program now that this article has received some attention? Jill Dutt: Perhaps. I'll have to ask her. Germantown, Md.: Do you think it is ever too late to find a mentor? I'm in my mid-30s and moving up in my career but would really like to have a mentor. Jill Dutt: No, I don't think it's ever too late. We all have something we can learn from someone else. Those of us in mid-career might look not just for someone who we admire, but also an individual who has experience doing something particularly well that is difficult for us. You know, more situation-specific mentoring. I'm always asking colleagues who are particularly adept at something for their advice about how to handle difficult situations. College Park, Md.: It seems more women are around me now at work than ever before (I'm a guy), the have to take over the world soon... Do you see that in the next 5 years. Jill Dutt: Gwen King talked about how boards of directors are still dominated by men, although women are certainly making inroads. I think once we get to levels where women are 30 percent or more of corporate boards, that will be the time we'll start seeing more women as chief executives. I don't know if we'll see numbers that high in 5 years, but in 10 I think we'll be there. Many of the women talked about how their crops of young corporate talent are full of women. Washington, D.C.: What are the most common mistakes made by women who are trying to advance their careers? Jill Dutt: Trying to do too much, causing everything in their life to suffer, and then not asking for help. That has sunk many a woman. Washington, D.C.: Too often, media profiles of women executives focus on the sacrifices they had to make between balancing work and family. The same is rarely true for profiles of men. Your piece did a wonderful job of avoiding that trap. Did you intentionally set out to do that? Jill Dutt: Yes. Although we talked in the interview about the balances and tradeoffs one makes, I didn't want to focus on that unless it had a significant impact on the course of the executive's career. Thanks for all your questions. This has been fun. An Unspeakable Affliction; Urinary Incontinence Mortifies Millions of Women. Luckily, It's Not a Life Sentence  When you gotta go, you gotta go. But what if you're sitting in the front pew at your daughter's wedding? Or on an airplane with the seat-belt light glowing? If you find you don't always make it to the bathroom in time, or you leak urine when you jump, cough or laugh, you are among millions of women who struggle with urinary incontinence. One woman in three suffers at least occasional incontinence, but embarrassment has long kept most of them from acknowledging the problem. Thankfully, that is now changing. Incontinence is getting the attention it deserves--and many women are discovering they can beat it. In women who have given birth vaginally, the most common type is stress incontinence--leakage caused by the physical stress of coughing, laughter or sudden movement. Stress incontinence occurs because the urethral sphincter (the muscle that opens and closes the urethra) or the pelvic-floor muscles have been weakened. The other common form--""urge incontinence""--involves an overactive bladder muscle. If you're sprinting for the bathroom more than seven times a day, you probably have urge incontinence. It's often associated with aging or sometimes with an underlying illness, but some women develop it when they consume acidic substances, such as citrus, tomato or pineapple. Whatever the type or the cause, urinary incontinence can be devastating. Women who suffer from it often become isolated and depressed. They may stop traveling, or decline social invitations. Some sufferers give up physical activities, gain weight and begin to see themselves as old and disabled. Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. With help from your doctor, and a little trial and error, you can devise a strategy for managing the condition. Fluid management. Give up that old advice about drinking eight glasses of water every day. You don't need that much liquid--and your bladder doesn't need the pressure. Drink just enough to quench your thirst. Cut back on caffeine and alcohol, especially before bed or when you're not near a bathroom, and avoid acidic fruits and drinks. Bladder training. Emptying your bladder the minute it complains can actually make it more demanding. So train your bladder to go less often. For a day or two, keep track of how often you urinate. Then try extending the usual interval by 15 minutes. And once you're comfortable with the new interval, extend it by another 15 minutes. Over several weeks or months you may find you can wait three hours or more, and have fewer episodes of urgency or leakage. Pelvic-floor training. Kegel exercises are not just for pregnant women. Done correctly, they can strengthen the pelvic-floor muscles that support the bladder and urethra. To locate your pelvic muscles, pretend you are trying to avoid passing gas in an elevator. At the same time, squeeze the way you would to compress a tampon. Once you've learned to exercise these muscles in short, quick contractions, try extending the contractions up to a maximum of 10 seconds. One simple regimen is to do 10 contractions before getting up in the morning, 10 standing after lunch, 10 in the evening while sitting and another 10 before falling asleep. Whether you suffer from stress incontinence or urge incontinence, flexing these muscles can help you avoid accidents. Medications Drugs known as anticholinergics can help alleviate urge incontinence by stabilizing the overactive bladder muscle. The most common ones are oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol). They're effective in about 40 percent of women, but can cause dry mouth and other side effects. The new slow-release versions are easier to tolerate. Other medications can worsen urinary incontinence. Diuretics may rapidly fill the bladder, for example, and the blood-pressure drug terazosin (Hytrin) may relax the bladder outlet muscle. Talk with your doctor if you suspect these treatments are causing trouble. Surgery. This is also an option, primarily for stress incontinence. In one common procedure, the surgeon implants a strip of synthetic mesh to support the urethra when the surrounding muscles can't. The ""urethral sling"" goes in through two small incisions in the lower abdomen and stays in place without sutures as your body covers the mesh tape with scar tissue. Electrical stimulation. This procedure desensitizes the bladder muscle and may help improve urge incontinence. It can be done in a doctor's office or at home. Given all these options, almost anyone can find some relief. So work with your doctor to find an approach that suits your preferences. Incontinence doesn't have to rule your life.

Health for Life M.D.: Our Doctor's Advice; Online Readers Sent Us Questions About Women's Medical Issues. We Asked a Harvard Doctor to Help  Richmond, Va.: I'm having a hysterectomy because of fibroids, and I want to leave my ovaries in. What are the pros and cons? Celeste Robb-Nicholson, M.D.: If your ovaries are normal, there is no need to remove them during a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids--or any other time, for that matter. If you're premenopausal, there are good reasons to keep your ovaries. They will continue to make estrogen until they naturally stop at menopause. If you have your ovaries removed before that, you'll quickly begin to feel the symptoms of menopause. Postmenopausal women who undergo hysterectomy for fibroids often elect to have their ovaries removed because they're no longer making estrogen anyway. One other factor some experts take into consideration: the ovaries do make some testosterone. No one is sure how important that is for the health of the pre- or postmenopausal woman. Fair Oaks, Va.: Is there a limit to the length of time one should continue to take fertility drugs, Clomid in particular? I'm on my third cycle, so far without success. For women who ovulate irregularly, infrequently or not at all, fertility drugs such as Clomid (clomiphene) can certainly help them achieve pregnancy. Clomid works by stimulating the pituitary gland (a small gland in the brain) to produce the hormones that cause an egg to ripen and be released by the ovary. Experts agree that for most couples, three to six cycles is a reasonable trial for Clomid. After that it may be time to explore other options. There has been concern that long-term use of ovulation-inducing drugs might increase a woman's risk for ovarian cancer. Studies on this issue suggest that there may be a connection between infertility and ovarian cancer. But experts think it's more likely that what's behind the increased ovarian-cancer risk is the underlying infertility--not the drugs used to treat it. Kalamazoo, Mich.: I'm 52, and my periods have all but stopped. I'm interested in hormone replacement with estrogen and progesterone creams. What are your thoughts about these natural hormone creams? Many women have become more interested in hormone creams since researchers determined that the risks of the hormone-replacement therapy Prempro--namely, breast cancer and cardiovascular disease--outweigh its benefits. But I have some concerns about these compounded-hormone creams. Taking estrogen and progesterone in any form after menopause is not ""natural,"" because at that stage of reproductive life, a woman's ovaries don't normally pump out these hormones. And any compounded-hormone product is a drug, just like one made by a pharmaceutical company. It may be that all forms of estrogen and progesterone carry the same risks as Prempro, which is the only one that's been tested. The FDA has ruled that they must all carry warning labels. Furthermore, with individually compounded drugs, we don't know precisely how much of each hormone is absorbed into the body. Quality control is also a concern. Drugmakers are required to show that each pill, patch or cream is of uniform quality. Compounding pharmacies are not required to demonstrate such uniformity or consistency. The decision to use a compounded cream, like so many of our health choices, is a matter of weighing risks and benefits. When a treatment has not been tested in large groups of women, you'll need to decide how much undocumented risk you're willing to take for the benefit you hope to get. If you use such a cream, be sure to tell your clinician so that she or he can determine how best to monitor you. Woodinville, Wash.: As a woman in her mid-50s, I've been through every fitness craze since the early '70s. Now I want to stay fit without running my joints into the ground. What do you recommend? Fortunately, things have changed since the ""no pain, no gain"" days. Researchers have found that 30 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activity on most days of the week can achieve functional fitness and reduce the risk of disease. If you want to spare your joints, swimming, yoga, Pilates, tai chi and weight training are also good ways to get moderate exercise. For optimal benefits, especially weight control, you need to exercise longer--60 minutes on most days each week. That sounds daunting to many busy women. However, you don't need to fit all your exercise into one session or limit yourself to one activity. For example, take a brisk 15-minute walk during your coffee break and another after dinner. Bicycle for 20 to 30 minutes one day, rake leaves or do yardwork the next, and dance or follow a Pilates tape the next. It all adds up.

She cautions that readers should consult a medical professional before adopting or drawing inferences from any of the suggestions made in this article. Putting It All Together; New Medical Research Shows How Different From Men Women Really Are  Like most women, Kathy Cunningham, 49, a wife, mother and senior VP at a Chicago bank, was well acquainted with the emotional chambers in her heart. Joy, sadness, love. But Cunningham never thought much about her heart as a muscular pump: the size of a fist, weighing less than a can of soda, beating 100,000 times a day. And she certainly didn't think it was vulnerable to disease. The picture of fitness--a nonsmoker, slim, good blood pressure and cholesterol--Cunningham was most concerned about her reproductive health, and she was religious about getting mammograms and Pap smears. But two years ago she was rushed to the ER, sweating, short of breath, in pain. A test revealed a 90 percent blockage in a coronary artery. The diagnosis: heart attack. ""We all focus on breast cancer,"" says Cunningham. ""I had no idea women had heart disease."" Every year a quarter of a million women die of heart disease--more than the total number killed by breast cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's combined--making it America's No. 1 killer of women, as well as men. Women who have heart attacks are treated less aggressively, fare worse and die at higher rates than men. And yet the vast majority of women worry more about their husband's dropping dead than they do about the danger lurking in their own blood vessels. A new survey by the American Heart Association found that only 13 percent of women say they consider heart disease their greatest health risk, and barely more than one third have discussed the condition with their doctor. As the population ages and cardiovascular hazards like diabetes continue to rise, women are more at risk than ever. In response, public-health officials have launched nationwide awareness campaigns to sound the alarm about this ""silent killer."" Scientists are busy unraveling the unique and sometimes mysterious ways in which coronary disease develops in a woman's body. And doctors in the know are educating their peers, many of whom still operate under the bias that men have a monopoly on matters of the heart. All the attention is starting to pay off, says cardiologist Bernadine Healy, the first female director of the National Institutes of Health, who helped put women and heart disease on the map, ""but there's no doubt we have a way to go."" From an anatomical point of view, a woman's heart is no different from a man's: four chambers and several ounces of muscle tissue. But the symptoms of heart disease in men and women can appear as different as, well, the colors blue and pink. Men typically experience difficulty breathing and chest pain--still considered the hallmark symptom of a heart attack--which can travel up to the jaw and down the arm. Many women, however, feel no chest sensation at all, and their symptoms are often subtle: an unyielding fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea or indigestion, back or abdominal pain, or just an odd, unwell feeling. Compounding all that is the fact that too many women downplay their own health for the sake of their families, says Dr. Vera Rigolin, of Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital: ""They tend to ignore the symptoms because they have to take care of everybody else."" Carolyn O'Donnell, 62, remembers feeling ""like a wuss"" when her husband made her go to the ER. A runner and golfer, O'Donnell is normally an upbeat, high-energy grandmother of four. But on April Fool's Day 2002, she felt a little bit off. She was tired, she had a headache and she noticed an odd sensation near her heart. It was mild, though, no radiating pain, nothing more than ""a mouse on my chest,"" she says, not that elephant everybody worries about. Her self-diagnosis: probably just the flu. But O'Donnell's husband--luckily, a physician--insisted she be checked out. Doctors discovered a piece of plaque clogging a crucial artery and a heart working at half its normal capacity. The ""flu"" was a full-blown heart attack. Today O'Donnell's health is back to normal. She takes a daily aspirin and an ACE inhibitor, which relaxes the muscles of her blood vessels. And now, more than ever, she's aware of the danger. ""The symptoms,"" she says, ""are sneaky."" The internal manifestations of women's heart disease can be deceptive as well. Both men and women accumulate plaque, a buildup of fat on vessel walls, which can cause dangerous clogs in blood flow and lead to heart attack or stroke. But women often distribute these deposits in what doctors describe as a more ""diffuse"" manner than men. Instead of gathering in clumps or bulges, the plaque is spread more evenly along the vessel lining. Women, says Dr. Sujoya Dey of the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center, ""don't always present with one big kink in the garden hose."" That distinction may explain some of the striking variations in the way men and women with heart disease tend to be treated. Diagnostic tests look for blockages, says Dr. C. Noel Bairey Merz of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and yet clear-cut clogs don't show up in one third of women who have heart attacks. Instead of diagnosing disease, says Bairey Merz, ""the cardiologist says, 'I don't know what's wrong with you'."" That, coupled with a woman's tendency to brush off symptoms, can result in catastrophes that should be avoidable, she says. In general, women are less likely to receive medications like cholesterol-lowering drugs or devices like pacemakers or stents (which keep clogged arteries open) after heart disease has been diagnosed. Dey and her Michigan colleagues recently analyzed data from more than 10,000 male and female patients and found that even when men and women had similar severity of disease, women were less often given aspirin, which help dissolve blood clots, and beta-blockers, which prevent future heart attacks. A woman who knows her risk factors may be able to avoid heart disease in the first place. Genes and family history up the odds, and so does plain old aging. Young women are not invulnerable, but heart disease typically strikes women after menopause, starting in their late 50s or their 60s. That's about 10 years later than men, and could account for why women fare worse after heart attacks and die at a higher rate--they're frailer and already suffering from other diseases. Given the average age of onset, if a woman's mother had coronary disease early on--especially below the age of 50--a red flag should go up, says Dr. Erica Jones of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York. ""I take that very, very seriously."" Most risk factors are gender-blind. Smoking and inactivity are the pillars of bad health, gunking up arteries and depriving the cardiovascular system of the nutrition it needs. Depression and stress can likely trigger heart problems and make existing disease worse. And then there's the cascade of events that starts with unhealthy, high-fat eating: a spike in cholesterol and obesity, which can then trigger the debilitating effects of diabetes. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop heart disease than nondiabetics, and yet one third of Americans don't even know they have it. All these risk factors strike particularly hard in minorities: the death rate from heart disease is 69 percent higher in African-American women than in whites. ""When we look at the numbers,"" says Dr. Donna Mendes of New York's St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, ""we know that something has to be done."" The message is beginning to get out. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is busy raising awareness through The Heart Truth, a nationwide campaign complete with a little pin shaped as a red dress, the new symbol of heart disease in women. The Association of Black Cardiologists has been spreading the word for years through churches. Now it's targeting hair salons, where beauticians are adding a new skill to snipping and styling: measuring their clients' blood pressure. And then there are individuals like Sylvia Woods, 78, who educates hungry customers in her famed Sylvia's Restaurant in New York City. Woods herself underwent an angioplasty for a blocked artery; now she's making soul food more heart-healthy. There's less butter, grilled catfish and no more pork in the collard greens. The rich flavors? ""Grandma kicks it up a notch with the spices,"" says Woods's granddaughter Tren'ness. No magic pink pill is going to eliminate heart disease in women, but new guidelines from the American Heart Association spell out how to ward it off. Unhealthy habits account for a whopping 82 percent of heart disease in women, which puts lifestyle interventions at the top of the list. It can never be said too many times: stop smoking, get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, eat lots of fruits and veggies. Blood pressure should be less than 120 over 80. HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol, should be above 50; LDL, the ""bad,"" below 100. The AHA guidelines come down firmly on what not to do, as well, starting with hormone-replacement therapy. Researchers long assumed that estrogen was the elixir protecting young women's hearts, which is why HRT was prescribed to postmenopausal women. But the landmark Women's Health Initiative study found that estrogen and progestin actually increased the incidence of heart disease and stroke. And newer data from a trial of estrogen alone have found no heart benefit whatever. ""We can now say emphatically that HRT shouldn't be taken for the express purpose of preventing heart disease,"" says Dr. JoAnn Manson of Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital and a WHI investigator. Doctors will never unlock the emotional mysteries of a woman's heart, but as they continue to unravel its biology, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease should improve. Nothing, however, can replace awareness and vigilance. Women must know their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, calculate their risk factors, pepper their doctors with questions and take symptoms seriously. The beauty is that women are already in touch with their hearts--now they just have to listen to them more carefully. Female Officers Cross Cultural Frontier in Iraq; Women on Patrol Near Iran Brave Insults and Disapproval  ""How can your family allow you to work a job like this?"" ""You are shameful."" ""Women were created for being in the house."" Each day, the name-calling and barbs begin almost as soon as Shinaa Rasul slings her AK-47 rifle over her shoulder and steps out of her barracks to the snowy valley that separates her country from Iran. Rasul and 53 others are part of an Iraqi Border Patrol unit stationed on the 920-mile Iranian frontier. And as the patrol's first all-female outfit, they have become a spectacle for the thousands of people who cross between the two countries each day. When people spot the patrols, with their neat brown uniforms and firearms, Rasul said, they typically have one of two reactions: ""They are either upset or afraid."" Under the rule of former president Saddam Hussein, Iraq was a largely secular state, and women -- particularly in urban areas -- were free of many of the constraints placed on them in other Muslim countries. Accorded the same opportunities as men in education and professions, many women rose to positions of prominence. But postwar Iraq's leadership vacuum has been filled principally by religious leaders, many of whom advocate a system of governance more in line with Islam than Hussein's Baathist state was. Before departing Iraq, the U.S.-led occupation authority hopes to ensure the rights of women are protected and appreciated by Iraqis. The United States is spending millions of dollars and a great deal of effort to create women's support centers, women's entrepreneurship groups, women's job training programs and women's cultural and political seminars. The Border Patrol initiative is arguably the most visible of those projects. ""We are crossing a lot of cultural boundaries,"" acknowledged Staff Sgt. David Spence-Sales, who serves with the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division and helped train the female officers. Such efforts have been applauded by many Iraqis, who point out that women make up about 60 percent of the population. Some groups have pressed the occupation authority to do even more, pointing out that only three of the 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council are women and that none serve on the committee drafting the country's  constitution. But others, especially Iraq's powerful religious leaders, say the occupation authority's policy toward women is an example of how the United States is trying to impose its own values on a culture it doesn't understand or appreciate. In Najaf, a city that is holy to Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, a U.S.-appointed female judge was forced to step down after some clerics protested, saying that the Koran does not allow women to hold such jobs. And in Baghdad, some men passed out leaflets that called for the exclusion of women from local councils, which occupation officials have held up as a model of diversity. ""The occupation forces do not understand that they cannot impose Western culture over Islamic societies,"" said  Haider Nasrawy, spokesman for Hussein Sadr, a prominent Shiite cleric. In the Islamic world, interpretations of centuries-old religious and tribal customs regarding women differ from ayatollah to ayatollah, imam to imam. But even the most liberal agree that their religion dictates that in some cases women are not equal to men. In court, for instance, the word of two women carries the same weight as that of one man. In mosques, women must pray in the back, behind the men. And in issues of inheritance, daughters get half as much as sons. Several influential Sunni and Shiite leaders contend, however, that the different roles of men and women in Islamic society do not mean women are repressed. On the contrary, they say, women are revered and must be allowed to serve only in positions where they will be respected. They say they advocate initiatives to promote women to the highest ranks of society -- as doctors, professors, lawyers and the like -- but allowing women to serve in the police, army, Border Patrol or other security agencies is an insult. ""Many have identified Islam as a frightful thing that steals the freedom of people, especially women. This is all wrong,"" Nasrawy said. ""What Islam is about is women being dignified and keeping their morals, of sticking to the veil but at the same time being able to do great things for society."" Harith Dhari, a Sunni sheik and scholar, said his objections stem not from his opinion about a woman's abilities but from the question of whether a particular job will ""secure her dignity and the dispensation of her humanitarian mission in life."" In the beginning, at least, the women's Border Patrol unit was about practicality, not politics. Because of religious and cultural taboos on touching between men and women who aren't married or closely related, an all-male Border Patrol could not search women. U.S. Army Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, whose 101st Airborne is responsible for northern Iraq, called for women to join the new Iraqi security forces that the occupation authority was trying to create. He said he was worried that terrorists would use women to ferry equipment and messages back and forth. Several dozen responded. There were teachers, clerical workers and housewives as well as some former Kurdish guerrillas, known as pesh merga. Nida Muhammed, 52, said her cousins begged her to reconsider her decision to join. ""In general, our relatives didn't like the idea of us doing this job,"" said Muhammed, a grandmother of four. One of her colleagues, Asti Abdulla, 36, said she got a phone call from someone who said, ""If you go to this job, we'll cut off your legs."" Elite solders from the 101st Airborne were put in charge of training, and at first they worried that the women would be too timid and weak. Sgts. Jacob Dixson and Louis Gitlin said they were surprised to find that women did better than men in simulated missions. ""They would always find the bombs fast and search fast,"" Dixson said. Added Gitlin, ""The women had something to prove, so they took everything more seriously."" The Bashma border crossing station is two hours away, on a winding mountain road, from Sulaymaniyah, the closest major city. Between Bashma and other checkpoints lie miles of rugged terrain, full of land mines but shot through with secret paths developed over the centuries by smugglers. The women in the Border Patrol range in age from 17 to 54. They include young waifs with chips of  polish still on their fingernails and bulky, tough ones with wizened faces who carry several pistols and knives in addition to the AK-47s they are issued. Some joined for the money -- a decent $120 to $140 a month. Others such as Rasul, 21, a thin brunette who wears her curly hair in a ponytail that makes her look even younger, joined because she had been left an orphan as a teenager. Aftaw Muhammed Salih, 54, decided to join because the former government threw her 13-year-old son in jail, alleging that her husband opposed Hussein. ""Everyone has a brother or father or cousin who was killed by Saddam,"" said Nuksha Ali Kadir, 54, the women's platoon leader in Bashma. The women say they recognize that some religious leaders might object to their work. But they argue that their interpretation of the Koran makes them believe that working as a Border Patrol officer is a noble and respectable profession, and that objections to women carrying weapons or touching men in this capacity are old-fashioned. Female doctors can treat male patients, Kadir points out, so why shouldn't Border Patrol women be able to search men? The women in Bashma serve alongside a men's unit. They search people, mostly women, coming through the border posts and help the men's unit search vehicles and patrol the unmanned parts of the border. When traffic is especially heavy, they are called on to search men. They use the back of their hands, they say, and try to finish as quickly as possible, but it still makes everyone uncomfortable, especially when the men crack vulgar jokes. For the most part, the women's male counterparts say they are enthusiastic about having them there. They say the women are proficient in their jobs and that the border has become calmer since they arrived. But the Border Patrol is far from integrated. There are female commanders for women and male commanders for men, but while the male commanders sometimes give orders to women, the female commanders are never put in charge of men. And the women grumble that they aren't on the regular rotation for patrols and are only called on as needed. ""There is danger. . . . So for their protection, we don't want them to go out,"" explained Jamal Ali Karim, 27, the male platoon leader in Bashma. The first time the men saw the women fire their guns was when they celebrated Saddam Hussein's capture on Dec. 14. They were impressed. ""Men are better than women at shots, but they are good,"" commented Rafeek Mohammed Mustafa, 31, a former university student. The women live in barracks next to the checkpoint, eight to a room. The bleak gray of the carpet and walls is in stark contrast to the girly things strewn about the room -- flowered sheets, a white plastic mirror and a brown purse with stylishly thin straps. There's no electricity, no hot water. In the long, chilly winter evenings, the women make tea and sit around the sole kerosene heater telling stories about themselves. One recent day, they sang love songs until 3 a.m. They say working in a remote border outpost is lonely and that they miss their families. The happiest day for the women was Sept. 16. That was the day the women's unit believes it caught its first terrorist. They had been searching four women when one began to protest that she was offended that someone was touching her head. She had long, thick black hair that was wrapped in a white scarf. That made Ronak Ali, 25, curious, and she unfurled the scarf and inspected the woman's hair. It was matted to her head with tiny pins, and when Ali slipped the pins out, she found a 4-by-6-inch note, written in black ink. It talked about bombings at several mosques on the Iraq-Iran border and was dated 1995. But Ali knew better. The mosques had been the target of attacks a few months before. She suspected it was a message from one terrorist cell to another. The women took the suspects into custody and handed them over to the U.S. military. Whenever she is down, Rasul says, she tries to remember this victory and what a passerby -- a woman, a stranger -- told her a few weeks after she started working on the border: ""You are doing a great job. Women are half of society, and you should be proud to be serving your country.""","Thousands of women's rights advocates gathered in  today for a march advocating safe abortions, birth control and sex education for women worldwide, and opponents of abortion also staged protests near the Mall.  reporters here chronicle some of the activities of the day. A Different Era for  As the march rounded onto Constitution Avenue, there was Gloria  about 10 paces back from the crowded, sweating front lines. No longer the official leader of an organization, freed from the pressure of being behind the front banner,  carried no sign, only a petite leather backpack and a tan leather jacket tied around her slim waist. ""We've never had a secretary of state in our front line before,"" she noted, gesturing ahead toward . Then she glanced around her, smiling at the chanting. She pumped her fist a few times, silver jewelry jangling, then brought it almost self-consciously down. Occasionally a young woman would dart up and shake her hand or an older one would ask for an autograph or tell her -- still glamorous and long-haired -- ""You look fabulous."" But mostly she seemed reflective. Then the chants started again, the young women surged forward and as a reporter passed, a woman said, ""You've talked to her enough."" Yet at that moment, there was nobody else there. -- , 3:15 p.m. A ""Die-In"" With dozens of police officers looking on, about 60 antiabortion demonstrators laid down in the middle of 15th Street and Constitution Avenue as part of a ""die-in"" an hour before the main march passed through. As the protesters began to draw figures of children in chalk on the street -- a symbolic nod to the age old police practice of outlining homicide victims --  Police Chief  took in the scene. ""The good thing about this ""die-in,""  told a top aide, ""is that it doesn't go against my homicide count."" -- , 3 p.m. Young and Old Drawn to Rally , 66, from , , was picnicking on the Mall as the tail of the march moved away from her. She said her three middle-aged children and six grandchildren were proof that she is not pro-abortion. But she said, ""I'm for choice."" ""There's no place for politics when it comes to choice. There's no place for religion when it comes to choice,"" she said. ""The only place for choice is in your heart."" , 41, of , , came to the march with two generations of women in her family, her mother and 4-year-old daughter, Isabel. ""My daughter's here for what?"" ""Choice!"" Isabel responded. -- , 2:30 p.m. A Tedious Chore The procession of marchers shuffled one head behind the other as they blindly walked toward RFK Stadium in the hope of finding a  stop. At the entrance to the dark pedestrian tunnel outside parking lot number 7, a friendly beacon told them the way. > ""Good morning, everybody. Glad you could make it,"" volunteer Cindy  said with a smile. ""When you go through here, you're going to the top of the stairs. When you cross the street, the Armory is on the left. That is your  stop,"" the volunteer said still smiling. An occasional ""Where you from,"" was interjected in her refrain which repeated minute after minute after minute. Finally  needed a break. After 3 1/2 hours she exhaled a tired ""harrumph"" and perched on a concrete slab. ""Boy I'm tired of saying that."" -- , 2:30 p.m. College Students Join In Thousands of students came to the rally and march from colleges across the country --  in , the , 's , and tiny , in , . About 40  students rode all night in vans to get to the rally. Several dozen undergraduates from  made a similar trip by bus. The students said women's reproductive rights still seemed fragile to them, even though they were born a decade or more after the 1973  decision that established a woman's right to abortion. , 19, a Colby student from , , said she was marching to demand safe and affordable birth control, quality health and sex education for girls, and full access to abortion. ""I have friends who had to go to  in high school to get abortions,"" to avoid the parental notification law in , she said. -- , 2:15 p.m. Can You Find Me Now? So many of the people at the march were using cellular phones that it was often hard to get a signal. , 27, of , sent a text message on her phone to a friend who was also on the Mall, hoping they would find each other in the crowd. Walking in front of her, , 27, of , used his cell phone to try to pinpoint the whereabouts of his 19-year-old sister. ""Are you in front of the  Monument,"" he asked  just after 1 p.m., striding in that direction from 7th Street N.W. Behind him,  laughed. ""Everyone's in front of the  Monument,"" she said. But , ever the big brother, persisted. ""Okay, you're in front of it. To the right or the left,"" he asked patiently. ""Okay, I know where you are,"" he said after a couple more exchanges. We'll try to make it up there."" -- , 2:15 p.m. ""They Don't Have a Clue""  of  was standing in the middle of 14th Street and  holding a picture of a 5-month-old fetus when suddenly she was forced into the middle of a group of abortion rights marchers and dragged nearly a half block. ""They grabbed me and pulled me in,"" said , 57. ""They locked their arms around me and they took my sign,"" said , who is a nurse, as she came back over to join her fellow anti-abortion protesters. She recalls 31 years ago when she was in nursing school holding a six-week-old fetus that had been miscarried and brought to the hospital in , , where she was working. She said it was two and a half inches long and it was definitely a male. ""It was a human being and it was visible at six weeks. These people don't understand the reality of what's going on. They don't have a clue. A human entity is formed early on and it's not part of a mother's body,"" she said. When , who said she was not afraid of the women who held her in their circle, broke loose they had forced a pro-choice sign in her hands. She threw it down on the ground.  of , , agrees with . She came to the march with about 80 people from ,  She said she remembers when she first got pregnant five years ago as a unmarried 20-year-old college freshman and had to tell her parents. Her parents were very disappointed -- her mother asked her if she had thought about getting an abortion and her father threatened to put her out of their home. But Maxwell said she never second-guessed her decision to continue her pregnancy. ""I kept faithful and prayerful,"" she said. Today Maxwell and her 5-year-old son, Christopher, with her along the march route. She's married to his father and is expecting another baby in October. Although she is working and goes to school, Maxwell said she would never dream of not having her baby. ""I think it would be selfish to say 'I have all these things going on in my life, I am going to kill this baby.' '' -- Yolanda Woodlee, 2 p.m.  Finding a Parking Spot Police had closed 14th Street to traffic, but 65-year-old George Trent of Annandale had no problem driving his fire-engine-red Lamborghini look-alike over the bridge and midway across the Mall. At 10:29 am, he parked behind the only other vehicle on the street, a car used to ferry march VIPs. Trent and his 10-year-old granddaughter, Kassandra Trent, disembarked and found themselves due east of the  Monument, directly behind the stage where the pre-march rally was in full swing. ""They usually let me park,"" Trent said. ""They see 'Lamborghini' written on it, they think you're a millionaire."" In fact, Trent is a working man, an information technology specialist with the General Services Administration. The vehicle he calls his ""dream car"" is actually a replica of a 1986 Lamborghini. It cost close to $50,000, Trent said, about half the price of the real thing. But that didn't stop scores of rally goers from gawking and staring, whipping out their cameras to immortalize this bit of luxury amidst the marchers, banners and signs. -- , 12:30 p.m.  Howard Dean Sighting Former Democratic presidential candidate Howard Dean caused a small ripple of excitement as he hurried west on Jefferson Drive toward the rally stage just before noon, trailed by a few aides. Rallygoers rushed to Dean, who was wearing a white shirt and a burgundy tie to shake his hand, snap his picture or wish him well. ""All right, Howard Dean! Way to go,"" shouted Marcy Bernstein, 60, of , , jumping up and down as she saw him. Bernstein said she came to the rally with a group from her synagogue, Greenwich Reform Synagogue. She had also attended the last major abortion rights gathering, in  in 1992. She came, she said, out of concern for her daughters -- both of whom stayed away to study for their college finals. She came, she said, so they would never have to face the choices she did, when she had an illegal abortion in the 1960s. ""Nobody should have to go through that,"" she said. -- , 12:30 p.m. A Sign Is Important ""I want 'Pro-choice, Pro-child,'"" Roberta Blumberg, 53, told the volunteers handing out signs at 14th Street and  today at about 9:30 a.m. She was already juggling two yellow and blue ""Who decides?"" signs attached to hollow cardboard tubes, but she wanted one with a ""pro-child"" statement. On a day with a multitude of messages, picking exactly the right combination was critical. So she took the ""Who decides?"" placard on one side and attached it to a ""Pro-child"" sign on a stick. ""Could you staple this one over here please,"" Blumberg, a registered nurse who came to the march with seven friends from Raleigh, N.C., asked a volunteer. ""Oh wait a minute, excuse me,"" she called to a woman passing by who had mistakenly taken her sign. That was her sign. -- Manny Fernandez, 11:30 a.m.  In Search of a Button It wasn't the abortion issue that drew Al Feldstein, his wife and a daughter to the Mall -- it was a much smaller issue. About the size of a half dollar to be exact. Feldstein, 54, of LaVale, Md., has been collecting protest and presidential campaign buttons since 1967, and his collection over the years has grown to nearly 10,000. He keeps thousands of these on display behind glass cases at home -- little footnotes of modern American history lining the walls of his den. Feldstein who works for the Maryland Department of Planning and describes his button collecting as a hobby, walked on the gravel of the Mall around 10 a.m. He wore 13 buttons on his green polo shirt. ""Excuse me,"" he said, approaching a woman who was wearing a ""Mothers Opposing Bush"" button, ""do you have one you can sell?"" Bingo. It was a few steps later when he saw a woman wearing dozens of buttons on her skirt and hat. A rival. ""I started in '67,"" he told the woman. The woman said she started in '70. ""Did you get one of these?"" he asked, pulling out his ""Mothers Opposing Bush"" button from his pocket. ""Yup."" -- Manny Fernandez, 11:30 a.m. Women Executives at 's Biggest Companies  Jill Dutt, the assistant managing editor for business, will be online to talk about her http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40173-2004Apr25.html feature profiles of nearly two dozen women executives at some of the  area's biggest companies and http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A40143-2004Apr25.html her article on ten of Marriott International's top female executives. Both pieces are tied to the annual http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/business/localbusiness/top200 Post 200 ranking of the region's top companies. Jill Dutt discusses her story and the Post 200. Editor's Note: post.com moderators retain editorial control over Live Online discussions and choose the most relevant questions for guests and hosts; guests and hosts can decline to answer questions. washingtonpost.com: Good afternoon. Thank you for joining us. For your Post 200 articles, you spoke to numerous female executives in the  region. Were there any themes you came across? Jill Dutt: Every executive was unique, but I was struck in all my interviews with how the women all credited their teams for having been the key to their success. It was true for many of them that building coalitions around their ideas was more successful than top-down, my-way-or-the-highway orders. Being a lawyer or a technology specialist also played central roles in these women being seen and recognized, as those jobs gave them exposure to the executive suite. , : What do you recommend to women who work for companies that are dominated by men who are uncomfortable working with women? Should they press on at the company or move on. Jill Dutt: Press on, of course! If you aren't being recognized or paid appropriately for the work you do, seek out people within the company who will champion your efforts. If there's no one there to do that, then benchmark your pay and performance with professionals at similar companies and present those results to your boss. If you still get the short end of the stick, then you probably should move on. It will be their loss and you'll know that for your colleagues and our daughters that you gave it your best shot. Vienna, Va.: What did the executives you interviewed say about what was lacking in the  area that could have helped them move forward either faster or further by this point in their career? Jill Dutt: There seems to be a lack of critical mass here of truly corporate women. Perhaps because the region is focused so intently on politics, government and advocacy organizations--and not so much on bottom-line, money-making enterprises--smart, talented corporate women can get overlooked. But, as several women said, the  area is a land of transients and so people in power are open to new blood coming in and that can be helpful to women. , : So why didn't Deborah Kissire create her network? Not enough interest? Are female executives here not as driven as their New York City counterparts? Jill Dutt: My sense is women here are as driven as anywhere. Certainly every one of the executives I interviewed were driven. The difference between New York and , one of the many differences, I think, is that New York is driven by making money and  is driven more by causes, by policy, by big ideas for shaping the world. Deborah didn't think her specific idea of a day-long program targeted to the issues facing C-level women would get enough attendance here. But that probably has to do more with a lack of critical mass than the passion, smarts or ambitions of -area women executives. Silver Spring, Md.: Do you have suggestions for finding mentors and networking? During my 10-year career, I found it really hard to make connections with people in a business environment. Jill Dutt: Just ask someone you really admire, someone you think can teach you something. She (or he) will likely be flattered that you recognize they have something others can learn from. Be sure to ask people not just because they're powerful and you calculate that they can help you get ahead. People will sense that ungenuine interest in their guidance. , : It seems like there are many more high-level women at the region's non-profit organizations. Why the discrepancy? Jill Dutt: I didn't interview the many dozens of powerful women at the region's non-profits. I think passionate women who have leadership material may be drawn to causes more than they're drawn to making a lot of money. But that is just an assumption on my part. You've given me an idea for a follow up article! Boston, : In your experience, would you say some industries or types of business (small, large, privat, public) are more female friendly than others? Could you name 5 top industries, professions that are invested in the promotion of women and 5 that aren't? Jill Dutt: Well, I have to admit I was surprised to find top women executives and board members of defense contractor Lockheed Martin. But perhaps I shouldn't have been, since in talking to folks there, they recognize that their customers--increasingly high-level women in government--are becoming more diverse. The women I interviewed came from a vast array of industries and all seemed to have found their way to a top spot. , : Of the two dozen you interviewed, what did these women have in common?And what did you find to be the biggest obstacle for women, specifically in this region? Jill Dutt: The women all seemed to have focused on their work, not networking. They are results-oriented. So many of them had been put in charge of projects to undertake major structural change inside their organizations and succeeded. I wondered if that skill has something to do with the idea that women can juggle lots of responsibilities and keep their center, set their priorities to get the job done. Perhaps it's also because those jobs appear unglamorous and non-threatening that women got the assignments in the first place. And then their coalition-building skills got them through the enormous challenge of actually implementing change. Those assignments get the attention and interest of top-level executives and a company's board, so they really seemed to be a place women could prove themselves. As for the biggest obstacle, I think it may be time. Many of the women experienced gender discrimination early in their careers, coming into professional corporate assignments in the 1970s. Those incidents might have knocked 5 or 10 years off their growth trajectory, but none were so egregious that it knocked them off-track. , : You mentioned that having a background as a lawyer or technical specialist played a role in the success of these women, do you think that it has something with the training that they received in those areas? Jill Dutt: Yes. In law, the process of having to think clearly and present logical, persuasive argument certainly helped some of these women speak the same language as the men in the room. As for technology, there, too, understanding how a system works and how it can be used to make a task more efficient helped several women. Also, because the tech field grew up at the same time these women did, there were fewer barriers to entry and they were able to increase their roles within companies at the same time the technology they were running became more robust and pervasive. , : Did the women that you interviewed indicate whether it is more beneficial to have a female mentor or male mentor or just a mentor? I am wondering if the idea is to adopt a more male approach to business or if there's a way to leverage characteristics/style of a woman. And, if so, then what is that style? Jill Dutt: Gail Steinel at BearingPoint spoke eloquently about this in our interview. I wish I'd had more space to include her comments in the article! She and I were talking about an article in this month's Harvard Business Review, entitled, ""Do Women Lack Ambition?"" We agreed that women only lacked the kind of ""ambition"" that is defined by men (speaking in generalities here, of course). Gail said early in her career she didn't realize that she was supposed to act differently because she was a woman; her parents had always told her she could do anything she set out to do (and she's proven them right). That said, she has learned in some ways to change her language in discussions, but she says she hasn't changed her management style. For example, when she has a feeling that a given course of action is the right one for a company to take, she says she doesn't use the word ""feelings"" in discussing it with men. She uses terms like ""gut instincts."" She says men respect that, but they almost visibly back away when the word ""feelings"" comes up. So, it's like Deborah Tannen says, even though men and women might be sensing the same thing, because they tend to use different language to get it across, misunderstandings can occur. Laura Paugh at Marriott talked about how, in this era when businesses need to collaborate with one another, not just compete, a woman's style of management seems to be more effective. Championing collaboration is one way to leverage the characteristic shared by many women. Fairfax, Va.: One of the things I've noticed about women who rise to the top is that they seem to have no trouble speaking their minds and standing up for themselves...yet, as junior-level employees, assertive women are often labeled as ""difficult,"" or ""aggressive,"" or any one of a number of unpleasant adjectives. I've noticed that men who share these same qualities are often rewarded for them, while women are punished by being passed over for promotions etc. Did these top women offer any strategies for dealing with this situation? Jill Dutt: Yes. Especially early in your career, when you need to speak your mind, make sure you have facts and data to back you up. It's just like that story MCI's Cindy Andreotti told. She knew ATT could come up with the technology product that would sell big--touch-screen bridal registry purchases--but none of the men in charge thought it would be profitable. She did the research and legwork to outline the whole technology piece that needed to get done, the marketing piece, the business plan, etc., and was so convincing (and right!) that no one could dismiss her as simply being ""difficult."" Catherine West at Capital One talked about being disarming and unchallenging in tone and style as being helpful to her in her career. You don't have to shout if you have command of your brief and can be quietly persuasive.  : Your article seem to exclude women in local government in very high positions, for example Suzanne Peck Chief Technology Officer for the District of Columbia. Jill Dutt: Yes. I only focused on women at companies that have more than $1 billion in annual revenue. The Post has done many stories about high-level women in government, politics and the media. I wanted to focus on a specific sliver: the women who hang in at the world's largest corporations and climb their way to the top. That's not to take away anything from the prodigious accomplishments of women like Suzanne. She is certainly formidable and, if she wanted to, could probably run her own company. , : Were any of the women minorities as well#63; Jill Dutt: Yes. Linda Gooden at Lockheed, Beverly Perry at Pepco and Beverly Burke at  Gas immediately come to mind. Fairfax, Va.: As a female CEO and recently transplanted Texan, I have discovered there are many networking opportunities in the ,  area, however, there appear to be few networking organizations or opportunities for C-level executives. Are there any you can recommend? Jill Dutt: The only one I know about is the Committee of 200. The National Association of Women Business Owners also has networking groups. Germantown, Md.: Do you think Deborah Kissire would be interested in trying again to recreate her networking program now that this article has received some attention? Jill Dutt: Perhaps. I'll have to ask her. Germantown, Md.: Do you think it is ever too late to find a mentor? I'm in my mid-30s and moving up in my career but would really like to have a mentor. Jill Dutt: No, I don't think it's ever too late. We all have something we can learn from someone else. Those of us in mid-career might look not just for someone who we admire, but also an individual who has experience doing something particularly well that is difficult for us. You know, more situation-specific mentoring. I'm always asking colleagues who are particularly adept at something for their advice about how to handle difficult situations. College Park, Md.: It seems more women are around me now at work than ever before (I'm a guy), the have to take over the world soon... Do you see that in the next 5 years. Jill Dutt: Gwen King talked about how boards of directors are still dominated by men, although women are certainly making inroads. I think once we get to levels where women are 30 percent or more of corporate boards, that will be the time we'll start seeing more women as chief executives. I don't know if we'll see numbers that high in 5 years, but in 10 I think we'll be there. Many of the women talked about how their crops of young corporate talent are full of women. , : What are the most common mistakes made by women who are trying to advance their careers? Jill Dutt: Trying to do too much, causing everything in their life to suffer, and then not asking for help. That has sunk many a woman. , : Too often, media profiles of women executives focus on the sacrifices they had to make between balancing work and family. The same is rarely true for profiles of men. Your piece did a wonderful job of avoiding that trap. Did you intentionally set out to do that? Jill Dutt: Yes. Although we talked in the interview about the balances and tradeoffs one makes, I didn't want to focus on that unless it had a significant impact on the course of the executive's career. Thanks for all your questions. This has been fun. An Unspeakable Affliction; Urinary Incontinence Mortifies Millions of Women. Luckily, It's Not a Life Sentence  When you gotta go, you gotta go. But what if you're sitting in the front pew at your daughter's wedding? Or on an airplane with the seat-belt light glowing? If you find you don't always make it to the bathroom in time, or you leak urine when you jump, cough or laugh, you are among millions of women who struggle with urinary incontinence. One woman in three suffers at least occasional incontinence, but embarrassment has long kept most of them from acknowledging the problem. Thankfully, that is now changing. Incontinence is getting the attention it deserves--and many women are discovering they can beat it. In women who have given birth vaginally, the most common type is stress incontinence--leakage caused by the physical stress of coughing, laughter or sudden movement. Stress incontinence occurs because the urethral sphincter (the muscle that opens and closes the urethra) or the pelvic-floor muscles have been weakened. The other common form--""urge incontinence""--involves an overactive bladder muscle. If you're sprinting for the bathroom more than seven times a day, you probably have urge incontinence. It's often associated with aging or sometimes with an underlying illness, but some women develop it when they consume acidic substances, such as citrus, tomato or pineapple. Whatever the type or the cause, urinary incontinence can be devastating. Women who suffer from it often become isolated and depressed. They may stop traveling, or decline social invitations. Some sufferers give up physical activities, gain weight and begin to see themselves as old and disabled. Fortunately, it doesn't have to be that way. With help from your doctor, and a little trial and error, you can devise a strategy for managing the condition. Fluid management. Give up that old advice about drinking eight glasses of water every day. You don't need that much liquid--and your bladder doesn't need the pressure. Drink just enough to quench your thirst. Cut back on caffeine and alcohol, especially before bed or when you're not near a bathroom, and avoid acidic fruits and drinks. Bladder training. Emptying your bladder the minute it complains can actually make it more demanding. So train your bladder to go less often. For a day or two, keep track of how often you urinate. Then try extending the usual interval by 15 minutes. And once you're comfortable with the new interval, extend it by another 15 minutes. Over several weeks or months you may find you can wait three hours or more, and have fewer episodes of urgency or leakage. Pelvic-floor training. Kegel exercises are not just for pregnant women. Done correctly, they can strengthen the pelvic-floor muscles that support the bladder and urethra. To locate your pelvic muscles, pretend you are trying to avoid passing gas in an elevator. At the same time, squeeze the way you would to compress a tampon. Once you've learned to exercise these muscles in short, quick contractions, try extending the contractions up to a maximum of 10 seconds. One simple regimen is to do 10 contractions before getting up in the morning, 10 standing after lunch, 10 in the evening while sitting and another 10 before falling asleep. Whether you suffer from stress incontinence or urge incontinence, flexing these muscles can help you avoid accidents. Medications Drugs known as anticholinergics can help alleviate urge incontinence by stabilizing the overactive bladder muscle. The most common ones are oxybutynin (Ditropan) and tolterodine (Detrol). They're effective in about 40 percent of women, but can cause dry mouth and other side effects. The new slow-release versions are easier to tolerate. Other medications can worsen urinary incontinence. Diuretics may rapidly fill the bladder, for example, and the blood-pressure drug terazosin (Hytrin) may relax the bladder outlet muscle. Talk with your doctor if you suspect these treatments are causing trouble. Surgery. This is also an option, primarily for stress incontinence. In one common procedure, the surgeon implants a strip of synthetic mesh to support the urethra when the surrounding muscles can't. The ""urethral sling"" goes in through two small incisions in the lower abdomen and stays in place without sutures as your body covers the mesh tape with scar tissue. Electrical stimulation. This procedure desensitizes the bladder muscle and may help improve urge incontinence. It can be done in a doctor's office or at home. Given all these options, almost anyone can find some relief. So work with your doctor to find an approach that suits your preferences. Incontinence doesn't have to rule your life.

Health for Life M.D.: Our Doctor's Advice; Online Readers Sent Us Questions About Women's Medical Issues. We Asked a Harvard Doctor to Help  , Va.: I'm having a hysterectomy because of fibroids, and I want to leave my ovaries in. What are the pros and cons? Celeste Robb-Nicholson, M.D.: If your ovaries are normal, there is no need to remove them during a hysterectomy for uterine fibroids--or any other time, for that matter. If you're premenopausal, there are good reasons to keep your ovaries. They will continue to make estrogen until they naturally stop at menopause. If you have your ovaries removed before that, you'll quickly begin to feel the symptoms of menopause. Postmenopausal women who undergo hysterectomy for fibroids often elect to have their ovaries removed because they're no longer making estrogen anyway. One other factor some experts take into consideration: the ovaries do make some testosterone. No one is sure how important that is for the health of the pre- or postmenopausal woman. Fair Oaks, Va.: Is there a limit to the length of time one should continue to take fertility drugs, Clomid in particular? I'm on my third cycle, so far without success. For women who ovulate irregularly, infrequently or not at all, fertility drugs such as Clomid (clomiphene) can certainly help them achieve pregnancy. Clomid works by stimulating the pituitary gland (a small gland in the brain) to produce the hormones that cause an egg to ripen and be released by the ovary. Experts agree that for most couples, three to six cycles is a reasonable trial for Clomid. After that it may be time to explore other options. There has been concern that long-term use of ovulation-inducing drugs might increase a woman's risk for ovarian cancer. Studies on this issue suggest that there may be a connection between infertility and ovarian cancer. But experts think it's more likely that what's behind the increased ovarian-cancer risk is the underlying infertility--not the drugs used to treat it. Kalamazoo, Mich.: I'm 52, and my periods have all but stopped. I'm interested in hormone replacement with estrogen and progesterone creams. What are your thoughts about these natural hormone creams? Many women have become more interested in hormone creams since researchers determined that the risks of the hormone-replacement therapy Prempro--namely, breast cancer and cardiovascular disease--outweigh its benefits. But I have some concerns about these compounded-hormone creams. Taking estrogen and progesterone in any form after menopause is not ""natural,"" because at that stage of reproductive life, a woman's ovaries don't normally pump out these hormones. And any compounded-hormone product is a drug, just like one made by a pharmaceutical company. It may be that all forms of estrogen and progesterone carry the same risks as Prempro, which is the only one that's been tested. The FDA has ruled that they must all carry warning labels. Furthermore, with individually compounded drugs, we don't know precisely how much of each hormone is absorbed into the body. Quality control is also a concern. Drugmakers are required to show that each pill, patch or cream is of uniform quality. Compounding pharmacies are not required to demonstrate such uniformity or consistency. The decision to use a compounded cream, like so many of our health choices, is a matter of weighing risks and benefits. When a treatment has not been tested in large groups of women, you'll need to decide how much undocumented risk you're willing to take for the benefit you hope to get. If you use such a cream, be sure to tell your clinician so that she or he can determine how best to monitor you. Woodinville, Wash.: As a woman in her mid-50s, I've been through every fitness craze since the early '70s. Now I want to stay fit without running my joints into the ground. What do you recommend? Fortunately, things have changed since the ""no pain, no gain"" days. Researchers have found that 30 minutes of moderately intense aerobic activity on most days of the week can achieve functional fitness and reduce the risk of disease. If you want to spare your joints, swimming, yoga, Pilates, tai chi and weight training are also good ways to get moderate exercise. For optimal benefits, especially weight control, you need to exercise longer--60 minutes on most days each week. That sounds daunting to many busy women. However, you don't need to fit all your exercise into one session or limit yourself to one activity. For example, take a brisk 15-minute walk during your coffee break and another after dinner. Bicycle for 20 to 30 minutes one day, rake leaves or do yardwork the next, and dance or follow a Pilates tape the next. It all adds up.

Putting It All Together; New Medical Research Shows How Different From Men Women Really Are  Like most women, Kathy Cunningham, 49, a wife, mother and senior VP at a Chicago bank, was well acquainted with the emotional chambers in her heart. Joy, sadness, love. But Cunningham never thought much about her heart as a muscular pump: the size of a fist, weighing less than a can of soda, beating 100,000 times a day. And she certainly didn't think it was vulnerable to disease. The picture of fitness--a nonsmoker, slim, good blood pressure and cholesterol--Cunningham was most concerned about her reproductive health, and she was religious about getting mammograms and Pap smears. But two years ago she was rushed to the ER, sweating, short of breath, in pain. A test revealed a 90 percent blockage in a coronary artery. The diagnosis: heart attack. ""We all focus on breast cancer,"" says Cunningham. ""I had no idea women had heart disease."" Every year a quarter of a million women die of heart disease--more than the total number killed by breast cancer, diabetes and Alzheimer's combined--making it America's No. 1 killer of women, as well as men. Women who have heart attacks are treated less aggressively, fare worse and die at higher rates than men. And yet the vast majority of women worry more about their husband's dropping dead than they do about the danger lurking in their own blood vessels. A new survey by the American Heart Association found that only 13 percent of women say they consider heart disease their greatest health risk, and barely more than one third have discussed the condition with their doctor. As the population ages and cardiovascular hazards like diabetes continue to rise, women are more at risk than ever. In response, public-health officials have launched nationwide awareness campaigns to sound the alarm about this ""silent killer."" Scientists are busy unraveling the unique and sometimes mysterious ways in which coronary disease develops in a woman's body. And doctors in the know are educating their peers, many of whom still operate under the bias that men have a monopoly on matters of the heart. All the attention is starting to pay off, says cardiologist Bernadine Healy, the first female director of the National Institutes of Health, who helped put women and heart disease on the map, ""but there's no doubt we have a way to go."" From an anatomical point of view, a woman's heart is no different from a man's: four chambers and several ounces of muscle tissue. But the symptoms of heart disease in men and women can appear as different as, well, the colors blue and pink. Men typically experience difficulty breathing and chest pain--still considered the hallmark symptom of a heart attack--which can travel up to the jaw and down the arm. Many women, however, feel no chest sensation at all, and their symptoms are often subtle: an unyielding fatigue, shortness of breath, nausea or indigestion, back or abdominal pain, or just an odd, unwell feeling. Compounding all that is the fact that too many women downplay their own health for the sake of their families, says Dr. Vera Rigolin, of Chicago's Northwestern Memorial Hospital: ""They tend to ignore the symptoms because they have to take care of everybody else."" Carolyn O'Donnell, 62, remembers feeling ""like a wuss"" when her husband made her go to the ER. A runner and golfer, O'Donnell is normally an upbeat, high-energy grandmother of four. But on April Fool's Day 2002, she felt a little bit off. She was tired, she had a headache and she noticed an odd sensation near her heart. It was mild, though, no radiating pain, nothing more than ""a mouse on my chest,"" she says, not that elephant everybody worries about. Her self-diagnosis: probably just the flu. But O'Donnell's husband--luckily, a physician--insisted she be checked out. Doctors discovered a piece of plaque clogging a crucial artery and a heart working at half its normal capacity. The ""flu"" was a full-blown heart attack. Today O'Donnell's health is back to normal. She takes a daily aspirin and an ACE inhibitor, which relaxes the muscles of her blood vessels. And now, more than ever, she's aware of the danger. ""The symptoms,"" she says, ""are sneaky."" The internal manifestations of women's heart disease can be deceptive as well. Both men and women accumulate plaque, a buildup of fat on vessel walls, which can cause dangerous clogs in blood flow and lead to heart attack or stroke. But women often distribute these deposits in what doctors describe as a more ""diffuse"" manner than men. Instead of gathering in clumps or bulges, the plaque is spread more evenly along the vessel lining. Women, says Dr. Sujoya Dey of the University of Michigan Cardiovascular Center, ""don't always present with one big kink in the garden hose."" That distinction may explain some of the striking variations in the way men and women with heart disease tend to be treated. Diagnostic tests look for blockages, says Dr. C. Noel Bairey Merz of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, and yet clear-cut clogs don't show up in one third of women who have heart attacks. Instead of diagnosing disease, says Bairey Merz, ""the cardiologist says, 'I don't know what's wrong with you'."" That, coupled with a woman's tendency to brush off symptoms, can result in catastrophes that should be avoidable, she says. In general, women are less likely to receive medications like cholesterol-lowering drugs or devices like pacemakers or stents (which keep clogged arteries open) after heart disease has been diagnosed. Dey and her Michigan colleagues recently analyzed data from more than 10,000 male and female patients and found that even when men and women had similar severity of disease, women were less often given aspirin, which help dissolve blood clots, and beta-blockers, which prevent future heart attacks. A woman who knows her risk factors may be able to avoid heart disease in the first place. Genes and family history up the odds, and so does plain old aging. Young women are not invulnerable, but heart disease typically strikes women after menopause, starting in their late 50s or their 60s. That's about 10 years later than men, and could account for why women fare worse after heart attacks and die at a higher rate--they're frailer and already suffering from other diseases. Given the average age of onset, if a woman's mother had coronary disease early on--especially below the age of 50--a red flag should go up, says Dr. Erica Jones of Weill Cornell Medical College of New York. ""I take that very, very seriously."" Most risk factors are gender-blind. Smoking and inactivity are the pillars of bad health, gunking up arteries and depriving the cardiovascular system of the nutrition it needs. Depression and stress can likely trigger heart problems and make existing disease worse. And then there's the cascade of events that starts with unhealthy, high-fat eating: a spike in cholesterol and obesity, which can then trigger the debilitating effects of diabetes. Adults with diabetes are two to four times more likely to develop heart disease than nondiabetics, and yet one third of Americans don't even know they have it. All these risk factors strike particularly hard in minorities: the death rate from heart disease is 69 percent higher in African-American women than in whites. ""When we look at the numbers,"" says Dr. Donna Mendes of New York's St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital Center, ""we know that something has to be done."" The message is beginning to get out. The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is busy raising awareness through The Heart Truth, a nationwide campaign complete with a little pin shaped as a red dress, the new symbol of heart disease in women. The Association of Black Cardiologists has been spreading the word for years through churches. Now it's targeting hair salons, where beauticians are adding a new skill to snipping and styling: measuring their clients' blood pressure. And then there are individuals like Sylvia Woods, 78, who educates hungry customers in her famed Sylvia's Restaurant in New York City. Woods herself underwent an angioplasty for a blocked artery; now she's making soul food more heart-healthy. There's less butter, grilled catfish and no more pork in the collard greens. The rich flavors? ""Grandma kicks it up a notch with the spices,"" says Woods's granddaughter Tren'ness. No magic pink pill is going to eliminate heart disease in women, but new guidelines from the American Heart Association spell out how to ward it off. Unhealthy habits account for a whopping 82 percent of heart disease in women, which puts lifestyle interventions at the top of the list. It can never be said too many times: stop smoking, get at least 30 minutes of exercise most days of the week, eat lots of fruits and veggies. Blood pressure should be less than 120 over 80. HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol, should be above 50; LDL, the ""bad,"" below 100. The AHA guidelines come down firmly on what not to do, as well, starting with hormone-replacement therapy. Researchers long assumed that estrogen was the elixir protecting young women's hearts, which is why HRT was prescribed to postmenopausal women. But the landmark Women's Health Initiative study found that estrogen and progestin actually increased the incidence of heart disease and stroke. And newer data from a trial of estrogen alone have found no heart benefit whatever. ""We can now say emphatically that HRT shouldn't be taken for the express purpose of preventing heart disease,"" says Dr. JoAnn Manson of Harvard's Brigham and Women's Hospital and a WHI investigator. Doctors will never unlock the emotional mysteries of a woman's heart, but as they continue to unravel its biology, diagnosis and treatment of heart disease should improve. Nothing, however, can replace awareness and vigilance. Women must know their blood pressure and cholesterol levels, calculate their risk factors, pepper their doctors with questions and take symptoms seriously. The beauty is that women are already in touch with their hearts--now they just have to listen to them more carefully. Female Officers Cross Cultural Frontier in Iraq; Women on Patrol Near Iran Brave Insults and Disapproval  ""How can your family allow you to work a job like this?"" ""You are shameful."" ""Women were created for being in the house."" Each day, the name-calling and barbs begin almost as soon as Shinaa Rasul slings her AK-47 rifle over her shoulder and steps out of her barracks to the snowy valley that separates her country from Iran. Rasul and 53 others are part of an Iraqi Border Patrol unit stationed on the 920-mile Iranian frontier. And as the patrol's first all-female outfit, they have become a spectacle for the thousands of people who cross between the two countries each day. When people spot the patrols, with their neat brown uniforms and firearms, Rasul said, they typically have one of two reactions: ""They are either upset or afraid."" Under the rule of former president Saddam Hussein, Iraq was a largely secular state, and women -- particularly in urban areas -- were free of many of the constraints placed on them in other Muslim countries. Accorded the same opportunities as men in education and professions, many women rose to positions of prominence. But postwar Iraq's leadership vacuum has been filled principally by religious leaders, many of whom advocate a system of governance more in line with Islam than Hussein's Baathist state was. Before departing Iraq, the U.S.-led occupation authority hopes to ensure the rights of women are protected and appreciated by Iraqis. The United States is spending millions of dollars and a great deal of effort to create women's support centers, women's entrepreneurship groups, women's job training programs and women's cultural and political seminars. The Border Patrol initiative is arguably the most visible of those projects. ""We are crossing a lot of cultural boundaries,"" acknowledged Staff Sgt. David Spence-Sales, who serves with the U.S. Army's 101st Airborne Division and helped train the female officers. Such efforts have been applauded by many Iraqis, who point out that women make up about 60 percent of the population. Some groups have pressed the occupation authority to do even more, pointing out that only three of the 25 members of the Iraqi Governing Council are women and that none serve on the committee drafting the country's  constitution. But others, especially Iraq's powerful religious leaders, say the occupation authority's policy toward women is an example of how the United States is trying to impose its own values on a culture it doesn't understand or appreciate. In Najaf, a city that is holy to Iraq's Shiite Muslim majority, a U.S.-appointed female judge was forced to step down after some clerics protested, saying that the Koran does not allow women to hold such jobs. And in Baghdad, some men passed out leaflets that called for the exclusion of women from local councils, which occupation officials have held up as a model of diversity. ""The occupation forces do not understand that they cannot impose Western culture over Islamic societies,"" said  Haider Nasrawy, spokesman for Hussein Sadr, a prominent Shiite cleric. In the Islamic world, interpretations of centuries-old religious and tribal customs regarding women differ from ayatollah to ayatollah, imam to imam. But even the most liberal agree that their religion dictates that in some cases women are not equal to men. In court, for instance, the word of two women carries the same weight as that of one man. In mosques, women must pray in the back, behind the men. And in issues of inheritance, daughters get half as much as sons. Several influential Sunni and Shiite leaders contend, however, that the different roles of men and women in Islamic society do not mean women are repressed. On the contrary, they say, women are revered and must be allowed to serve only in positions where they will be respected. They say they advocate initiatives to promote women to the highest ranks of society -- as doctors, professors, lawyers and the like -- but allowing women to serve in the police, army, Border Patrol or other security agencies is an insult. ""Many have identified Islam as a frightful thing that steals the freedom of people, especially women. This is all wrong,"" Nasrawy said. ""What Islam is about is women being dignified and keeping their morals, of sticking to the veil but at the same time being able to do great things for society."" Harith Dhari, a Sunni sheik and scholar, said his objections stem not from his opinion about a woman's abilities but from the question of whether a particular job will ""secure her dignity and the dispensation of her humanitarian mission in life."" In the beginning, at least, the women's Border Patrol unit was about practicality, not politics. Because of religious and cultural taboos on touching between men and women who aren't married or closely related, an all-male Border Patrol could not search women. U.S. Army Maj. Gen. David Petraeus, whose 101st Airborne is responsible for northern Iraq, called for women to join the new Iraqi security forces that the occupation authority was trying to create. He said he was worried that terrorists would use women to ferry equipment and messages back and forth. Several dozen responded. There were teachers, clerical workers and housewives as well as some former Kurdish guerrillas, known as pesh merga. Nida Muhammed, 52, said her cousins begged her to reconsider her decision to join. ""In general, our relatives didn't like the idea of us doing this job,"" said Muhammed, a grandmother of four. One of her colleagues, Asti Abdulla, 36, said she got a phone call from someone who said, ""If you go to this job, we'll cut off your legs."" Elite solders from the 101st Airborne were put in charge of training, and at first they worried that the women would be too timid and weak. Sgts. Jacob Dixson and Louis Gitlin said they were surprised to find that women did better than men in simulated missions. ""They would always find the bombs fast and search fast,"" Dixson said. Added Gitlin, ""The women had something to prove, so they took everything more seriously."" The Bashma border crossing station is two hours away, on a winding mountain road, from Sulaymaniyah, the closest major city. Between Bashma and other checkpoints lie miles of rugged terrain, full of land mines but shot through with secret paths developed over the centuries by smugglers. The women in the Border Patrol range in age from 17 to 54. They include young waifs with chips of  polish still on their fingernails and bulky, tough ones with wizened faces who carry several pistols and knives in addition to the AK-47s they are issued. Some joined for the money -- a decent $120 to $140 a month. Others such as Rasul, 21, a thin brunette who wears her curly hair in a ponytail that makes her look even younger, joined because she had been left an orphan as a teenager. Aftaw Muhammed Salih, 54, decided to join because the former government threw her 13-year-old son in jail, alleging that her husband opposed Hussein. ""Everyone has a brother or father or cousin who was killed by Saddam,"" said Nuksha Ali Kadir, 54, the women's platoon leader in Bashma. The women say they recognize that some religious leaders might object to their work. But they argue that their interpretation of the Koran makes them believe that working as a Border Patrol officer is a noble and respectable profession, and that objections to women carrying weapons or touching men in this capacity are old-fashioned. Female doctors can treat male patients, Kadir points out, so why shouldn't Border Patrol women be able to search men? The women in Bashma serve alongside a men's unit. They search people, mostly women, coming through the border posts and help the men's unit search vehicles and patrol the unmanned parts of the border. When traffic is especially heavy, they are called on to search men. They use the back of their hands, they say, and try to finish as quickly as possible, but it still makes everyone uncomfortable, especially when the men crack vulgar jokes. For the most part, the women's male counterparts say they are enthusiastic about having them there. They say the women are proficient in their jobs and that the border has become calmer since they arrived. But the Border Patrol is far from integrated. There are female commanders for women and male commanders for men, but while the male commanders sometimes give orders to women, the female commanders are never put in charge of men. And the women grumble that they aren't on the regular rotation for patrols and are only called on as needed. ""There is danger. . . . So for their protection, we don't want them to go out,"" explained Jamal Ali Karim, 27, the male platoon leader in Bashma. The first time the men saw the women fire their guns was when they celebrated Saddam Hussein's capture on Dec. 14. They were impressed. ""Men are better than women at shots, but they are good,"" commented Rafeek Mohammed Mustafa, 31, a former university student. The women live in barracks next to the checkpoint, eight to a room. The bleak gray of the carpet and walls is in stark contrast to the girly things strewn about the room -- flowered sheets, a white plastic mirror and a brown purse with stylishly thin straps. There's no electricity, no hot water. In the long, chilly winter evenings, the women make tea and sit around the sole kerosene heater telling stories about themselves. One recent day, they sang love songs until 3 a.m. They say working in a remote border outpost is lonely and that they miss their families. The happiest day for the women was Sept. 16. That was the day the women's unit believes it caught its first terrorist. They had been searching four women when one began to protest that she was offended that someone was touching her head. She had long, thick black hair that was wrapped in a white scarf. That made Ronak Ali, 25, curious, and she unfurled the scarf and inspected the woman's hair. It was matted to her head with tiny pins, and when Ali slipped the pins out, she found a 4-by-6-inch note, written in black ink. It talked about bombings at several mosques on the Iraq-Iran border and was dated 1995. But Ali knew better. The mosques had been the target of attacks a few months before. She suspected it was a message from one terrorist cell to another. The women took the suspects into custody and handed them over to the U.S. military. Whenever she is down, Rasul says, she tries to remember this victory and what a passerby -- a woman, a stranger -- told her a few weeks after she started working on the border: ""You are doing a great job. Women are half of society, and you should be proud to be serving your country."""
"NYT",2005,"Afghanistan","Women's Work","Elizabeth Rubin is a contributing writer for the magazine. She has reported extensively from Saudi Arabia, Chechnya and, most recently, Iraq.  After bumping along five hours of potholes and rock-strewn mountain switchbacks on the main commercial artery from Kabul to Pakistan early last month, I was surprised as we entered the Jalalabad Valley to see an enormous campaign poster, the size of a Times Square billboard, featuring not the boyish face of Hazrat Ali -- Jalalabad's most famous ex-warlord and a parliamentary candidate -- but that of Safia Siddiqi. It's striking enough that a woman would appear so boldly in such a poster in a city where women still do not appear in public without a burka -- more striking still that she was wrapped in a shawl made from the green, black and red of the Afghan flag. These colorful, patriotic images of Siddiqi also loomed over the streets of Jalalabad itself, offering a lush kind of hope for its residents. But Jalalabad is still a place dominated by Pashtunwali, the customary law that regulates life throughout the Pashtun belt (the eastern and southern half of Afghanistan). The Pashtun code is based on the values of honor, sanctuary, solidarity, shame and revenge, and it treats women as property. In such a place, how much difference can a few female politicians really make? Many Afghans question all the fuss over elections, and the $150 million expense, when, after three and a half years of American and international efforts, they still have few roads, unclean water and crumbling schools. And still every 30 minutes an Afghan woman dies in childbirth. The image of Afghan women is easily reduced to stereotypes. At one extreme is the hidden, voiceless, blue-burkaed cloud floating through the dusty streets behind her turbaned man. At the other is the endangered young feminist firing off a tirade against warlords. Both exist, but reality is mostly between the extremes. If nothing else, perhaps women in Parliament -- by law, 68 seats of 249 are reserved for women -- will begin to demolish these caricatures. In her rebelliousness, Siddiqi reflects a quality of Pashtun women that lives in the poetic memory of eastern and southern Afghanistan and was archived in a small book of women's poetry collected and edited by Sayd Bahodine Majrouh, one of Afghanistan's most revered modern poets. A dean of literature at Kabul University, a former governor of Kapisa Province, Majrouh, at age 59 in 1988, was assassinated in Peshawar, Pakistan, where the various mujahedeen factions fighting the Soviet Union were based. Shortly before his murder, Majrouh went through refugee camps in Pakistan to collect landays: simple two-line cries of emotion, usually recited by women to women at the river or the well or at wedding parties. They are physical and brutal, passionate and direct. One that was recited to me on a few occasions last month was almost a threat to the beloved. It shows how embedded is the tribal sense of honor for both men and women: ''If you do not have a wound in the center of your chest/I shall remain indifferent, even if your back is riddled like a sieve with holes.'' The women who composed and shared these poems, Majrouh wrote, ''feel repressed, scorned and thought of as second-rate human beings. From the cradle on, they are received with sadness and shame.. . .The father who learns of such an unwelcome arrival seems to go into mourning, whereas he gives a party and fires off a salvo of gunshots at the birth of a boy. Later, and without ever being consulted, the little girl becomes monetary exchange between families of the same clan.'' Majrouh, in exile among the hostile mujahedeen, seemed to identify with the anguish of Pashtun women. And he identified with their means of defiance -- the landays. They could be cries of despair: ''Cruel people, who see how an old man leads me to his bed/And you ask why I weep and tear out my hair!'' They could also be bold and desirous: ''Give me your hand, my love, and let us go into the fields/So we can love each other or fall together beneath the blows of knives.'' Safia Siddiqi has taken the boldness of the landays into both in politics and poetry. At a reading last year in Kandahar, attended more by men than women, she read from a poem of hers called ''I Am Telling the Truth.'' In it the poet addresses her lover, saying she wants to ''smother you with kisses/To put you in the swing of my lap/And to cover you/With the wings of my hair.'' Siddiqi has always enjoyed the spotlight and ached when it dimmed. She was born to a family of judges and religious scholars. Reared in the village of Nazarabad, just outside Jalalabad, she was taught at home and in Koran classes next door at the corner mosque. The Soviet invasion destroyed Nazarabad's village tranquillity, and the family was uprooted to Kabul. Siddiqi began tailoring at night near her house to supplement her father's reduced income. By 11th grade she had published a poetry collection, ''Veil,'' in which the chador became a metaphor for protection not just from strange men but also from the Soviet invaders. Siddiqi went to law school and was energized by the artistic and intellectual life of the university. ''It was the peak time for women's liberty,'' she told me. It all ended abruptly. The Communists were pressuring people like her to join the party. ''They were afraid of me at my college,'' she said. ''My education. My books.'' Her father decided to send the family to Pakistan. ''And there I was accused by the Islamists of being a Communist,'' she said. ''They wanted to kill me. It was Hekmatyar's party'' -- the Hezb-i-Islami, led by Gulbuddin Hekmatyar -- ''with those women in Saudi black burkas. And I hate those black burkas to this day.'' Yet she had to wear one herself. In Pakistan, she had no name, no degree, no poetry. She was just a poor refugee, and it made her crazy. She began to work at an entry-level job for an N.G.O., forced herself to learn English and rose in the ranks. Prominence attracted more threats, particularly from the Taliban after they captured Kabul in 1996. She wrote poetry of angry self-assertion and exploration. ''Who am I?'' begins one poem. ''Am I a nomad?. . . No I'm not a nomad, nor a refugee/ They are much better than me.'' Siddiqi also wrote: ''When I'm walking down the street, the people watch me/Disrespectfully and surprisingly/Watch me,/They are talking and saying/'Who is this lout?/Who is she?/Whose daughter is she?/Whose sister is she?/Whose wife is she?' Oh! Allah, is it honor?'' ''We had such a bad life in Pakistan as educated women because they never accepted our raising our voice,'' she told me. She formed a small group of activist women and eventually emigrated to Canada, where she met -- quite late by Afghan standards -- her husband, Asif Safi, an artist and journalist. He cuts an unusual figure in the Afghan landscape in his goth get-up: black wool pakool, black tunic, black baggy trousers, black shoes and long black hair. He's in charge of Siddiqi's security, and he is paranoid, with good reason. Already last year, when she and Safi were consulting for the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development, Siddiqi was attacked in a tough tribal region. Now that she was campaigning, she would have to go back. At the end of 2001, just after the Taliban scattered from their Kandahari stronghold, I received a strange proposal from Mullah Abdul Salaam, known as Rocketi, a neckless barrel of a Taliban commander. He was hiding in a remote village in Zabul, a province of sand dunes, camels and abandoned mud forts, peopled by suspicious men with thick kohl painted around their eyes and a taste for burning down girls' schools. Rocketi was wanted by the Americans. He had been the Taliban corps commander of Jalalabad -- not because he was in love with the Taliban but because all he really knew how to do was wage jihad and fire rockets (thus the nickname). He showed me his Stinger missiles, stashed away in a barn, and asked me to help him deliver them to the Americans in exchange for amnesty. I told him it was impossible. The next day he was forced to trust a man he didn't trust, Ismail Gailani, who is from one of the most respected religious families in Afghanistan. Rocketi tried to hide out in the mountains for a time but eventually landed in an American-run prison. That is why I was so surprised when I found him in Kabul this summer, in a fine black tunic and a long silver-and-black turban, on his way to the Afghan television studios to record a campaign ad for himself. He was running for Parliament, he said, on a simple platform: ''I say that I love all God's people.'' That's it? ''If you promise a lot and do a little, that is not delicious,'' he told me. ''But if you promise a little and do a lot, it will be very, very delicious.'' His smile soon turned to a frown, however, as he contemplated his chief misfortune: ''No matter how much I respect humanity and how great a person I am, my name still misrepresents me.'' Yet despite, or perhaps because of, his nickname, Rocketi's chances for winning a seat in Parliament were excellent. The Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission tried to force the adoption of an affidavit whereby candidates would have to pledge that they were never involved in any war crimes or drug dealing. ''It was never included,'' said Ahmad Nader Nadery, one of the commission's more outspoken members, when I went to see him shortly after meeting Rocketi. ''All that was left in the affidavit is that 'you are not in an armed group now.' '' So any commanders under suspicion simply turned in some weapons. Ultimately just a few dozen candidates were disqualified on the basis of arms. Nadery said that although warlords are a small proportion of the candidates, they were overshadowing the process. Which makes sense. Who, after all, has been running Afghanistan for the past 25 years? Many Afghans understandably wonder whether such elections aren't intended to show ''progress'' in nation building -- and give the United States a way out. On the western outskirts of Kabul, in a neighborhood still scarred by the mujahedeen rockets that tore apart Kabul during the civil war 10 years ago, Shukria Barakzai stepped from a silver Mercedes to greet a few dozen women waiting for her in the garden of a neighborhood elder. Though she's one of Kabul's higher-profile women -- she started a newspaper called Women's Mirror shortly after the Taliban fell and often appears on political talk shows in bright, translucent headscarves and high-heeled, pointy pink or ivory shoes -- on this day she had the air of a schoolgirl breaking taboos. A few days earlier, at the official start of campaign season, she took an unprecedented move for Afghan women and went wading through a crowded bazaar to address men and women, shopkeepers and taxi drivers and the police. She was thrilled by it. She also must have enjoyed the fact that it irritated her husband, and that there was nothing he could do about it. Like an Afghan version of a Tracy-Hepburn movie, both Barakzai and her husband were running for Parliament. And the tension was palpable between them -- two years ago, when she was battling warlords as a delegate to the loya jirga, or grand assembly, convened to agree on a constitution, she heard that he had taken a second wife. Her friends at women's organizations wanted to take to the streets to protest the laws that allow men to take up to four wives. Barakzai refused. She decided to ride out the change, instead, and in the process grow more familiar with the lives of ordinary Afghan women. During the campaign she mocked her husband's tactics. As a millionaire, she said, ''he doesn't have to do anything except have big lunches for people in trade halls.'' (He made his fortune as an exporter.) She teased that he liked it that way because he is uncomfortable with public speaking. So, unlike Shukria -- who had not hung up any posters yet, preferring radio and TV appearances and the woman-on-the-street approach -- her husband had his team plaster a photograph of himself in a suit and tie, with a horse as his voting emblem, all over the trees and billboards and shop windows of Kabul. The women waiting to hear Barakzai beneath the grapevine canopies were illiterate. The neighborhood still had no power, no roads and no buses to take anyone to work if there was any work to be had. The odor of open sewage wafted through the streets and gardens. Some women told Barakzai that their husbands wouldn't let them get their voting-registration cards. One said to me, ''This is Afghanistan, and the men are rotten-natured,'' and a chorus of laughter ensued. Unimaginable cruelty had been meted out in this neighborhood just 10 years ago. The women remembered it vividly. One woman had lost 17 members of her family. These women were mystified that the same people who ''fried us in oil and pounded nails in our heads'' were in power, running for Parliament. Even worse, said one woman with a laugh, ''people will vote for them.'' Barakzai told them to vote for women instead. Otherwise, ''the Mujahedeen leaders will suffocate us,'' she said. ''But they won't be able to oppress you with a strong female voice in the Parliament.'' This was campaign-trail chatter, though; in private, she admitted that everything depended on the quality of the women elected. Many female candidates were put up by husbands whose records, even by Rocketi standards, were too tarnished. Others were put up by the Islamist parties. Barakzai hauled herself up onto the bed of a pickup and addressed a crowd of young men. When one of them told me he was going to vote for the mullah Sayyaf because he had served his country all these years, an old woman from behind the mesh of her burka said: ''Oh, you're a good one. We're waiting like beggars for wheat because of the service of people like him.'' Having lived through the civil war, through Taliban rule, through the complicated compromises she observed and participated in as a delegate to the constitutional loya jirga, Barakzai was realistic about the composition of Afghan society. And she was realistic about an American policy that still supported the old commanders in the belief that inclusion was the best way to preserve stability in Afghanistan. ''Of course, 75 percent of our Parliament will be commanders and drug lords,'' she told me. ''But, on the other hand, it's a kind of pluralism of the last three decades. And some people say it's better they are all coming together.'' When a news report said that U.S. soldiers were desecrating the Koran at Guantanamo, thousands of enraged men marched through Jalalabad's streets, torched government buildings, the Pakistani consulate and foreign aid agencies, chanted ''death to America'' and burned an effigy of President Bush. In the parliamentary campaign, this same spirit manifested itself in a political allergy to the rhetoric of human rights, women's rights and all Western-sounding values. Anti-human-rights rhetoric also makes for good old-fashioned politicking, the kind that easily rouses the emotions of men, reminding them of the simpler days of jihad against the Soviets, when the mujahedeen were somehow heroes of both the Islamic and the Western worlds, and even seen as fighting for human rights -- not as war criminals or the followers of war criminals. At a sunbaked rally for the ex-commander Hazrat Ali, a white-haired, long-bearded blind mullah energized the crowd when he took to the podium and began cursing human rights. ''The Koran says women cannot ask for divorce,'' he cried, ''whereas human rights say women should ask for divorce! In the name of human rights we are told to release fornicators and thieves from prison. We know anyone who steals should have his hand cut off. Human rights says, 'No.' You should vote for someone who can fight all those who want to bring human rights law in Islamic law. We need a Moses to save us, and that is Hazrat Ali.'' A great rumbling and clapping ensued. The women of Jalalabad understand the mentality they are up against. Safia Siddiqi and her leading female rival, Saima Khogiani, do not pepper their speeches with talk of women's rights or changing traditions. They speak of the honor of the Pashtun woman, and of how the Pashtuns respect their women. They warn the men of the dangers of succumbing to the bribes of old warlords and rich, lying candidates. They offer the service of their clean past. And they play on the pride of the Pashtun. When I first met Saima Khogiani, a 34-year-old former schoolteacher, she was sitting cross-legged, curled over herself, on the floor of the crumbling Jalalabadi house she'd rented for her campaign offices. She peered at me from beneath the brown embroidery of a black wool scarf. She was rough and defensive, armored with a sardonic smirk. Khogiani faced the ire of her local mullahs when she first decided to run for office. Her uncles wouldn't speak to her. But she insisted and -- despite the curse of one mullah, who warned that the people would be sending 12 generations of their ancestors to hell if they voted for her -- the men were turning up to check her out and offer support in return for assistance. She had a small army of some 15 male cousins who stayed with her and decided where she could campaign. She was the only woman in the entire family who was allowed to meet with men. ''This one,'' a cousin said, pointing to Khogiani's gregarious young niece, ''will be banned from the men's room in two years.'' The young niece pouted. Then she said she didn't care because she was going to become a doctor. But at a campaign stop up in the mountains, in a settlement of salmon-colored mud-and-straw houses, the women were uninterested in women's rights. After reciting a landay about perpetual poverty, one woman was urged by the others to tell Khogiani about their opium problem. ''We know it's not good for Afghanistan, but it solved all our problems,'' she said. ''It grows in drought, with almost no water. And it sells for a good price.'' The men vowed that they would plant poppies again this autumn, even under the threat of death. As Khogiani said, ''The people lost their poppy, and the Americans and the government have not fulfilled their promises of an alternative-livelihoods program.'' The United States Agency for International Development has begun financing short-term projects -- like clearing ditches -- that local communities would have done anyway. It is not a true alternative, and while the farmers will lose their opium income, the governors, police chiefs and smugglers will simply traffic in opium grown elsewhere. After returning to Afghanistan, Safia Siddiqi, like Shukria Barakzai, was a delegate to the constitutional loya jirga, where she spoke up to defend a young woman who had condemned the jihadis for their crimes against ordinary Afghans -- then, for the sake of peace, urged the same young woman to apologize. Siddiqi understands politics well, as I saw when we drove out to her home district of Surkhab, a 40-minute drive from Jalalabad. The village elders had all gathered in a leafy outdoor meeting ground and dragged along their young men, who could be heard grumbling on the sidelines about how bored they were of political campaigns. Siddiqi appealed to them as Pashtuns, pressing them not to accept money or food in exchange for their votes. She appealed to the male elders, recognizing the suffering of their community and the uselessness of succumbing to warlords. She was in the village of her uncles and cousins. They all knew her father, knew that she's the daughter of a judge. This was a village still without television, where all the children gather at night to hear an elder tell them the love story of Saiful Maluk, son of the king, and Badri Jamal, a fairy girl. The story can take three nights or longer. When Siddiqi invoked the elders, she was signaling that she understood that they will decide who gets the votes; most likely it would be her. This is how politics works in the countryside. Siddiqi wrapped up her speech with another effort at tribal bonding: ''You and I are Pashtuns. We appreciate and respect women more than the others. And I will not be able to talk as freely to others as I do to you.'' Still, when she did speak to others -- for example, educated women in Jalalabad at the government's Department of Public Works -- her tone was markedly different. ''Our men are uneducated,'' she told them. ''Our women don't have jobs. And when you go out, everyone stares at you. If you remove your chador, everyone will call you a bad woman. The girl who should go to school is getting tailoring education because she has to make money for her family. Our kids should go to school, have teachers even at home. Should we vote for someone who intimidates or stops women from going to school? They want to make us scared of everything so we stay at home and out of politics. But we want to help the culture. Who was Malalai?'' Siddiqi was referring to the 19th-century Pashtun heroine who braved British guns to raise the Afghan flag. ''She was a woman. A hero of our country. The reason we don't have any other Malalai is because we have people who won't allow us to go to school.'' As if on cue, a teacher interrupted and said: ''Prove to us that the rights of men and women are the same in Islam. Because the men are saying: 'Don't vote for women. It's not Koranic. It's only the command of Bush's wife, Laura, that women are candidates.' '' A few days later, Siddiqi made the mistake of accepting an invitation to the most remote region of Khogiani, Saima Khogiani's tribal base. It's a place of lurking Taliban, where roadside bombs are now commonplace and people joke that the women have to do most of the work because the men are all hiding from blood feuds. Siddiqi delivered her speech to hundreds. Then, just as they were rolling out of the village, rockets and grenades and rifle fire hit her convoy. A few of the police officers in the leading car were wounded. Siddiqi lay with her brother on the ground and then walked for hours to escape from the village. Yet a week later, when most of the female candidates were lying low, ordered by their families to campaign only at home by receiving visitors, Siddiqi rallied for one last splashy trip through the bazaar of Jalalabad. In a coasting S.U.V. she popped out of the sunroof and addressed the crowd through a loudspeaker. Men followed her progress in mild horror. ''Look at this cow out of the car,'' one shopkeeper said. ''Isn't she ashamed to wander through the bazaar?'' another said. But no, she wasn't, and as she passed though Pashtunistan Square she confronted the people of Nangarhar with her promises and her questions. ''This was the second attack that happened to me here'' -- the first was last year. ''Did I kill someone? Did I steal something? Are my hands red with blood? Why did you take the weapon to kill me? It is not in our culture to kill a woman without reason.'' She thanked the crowd for their support. Then her husband jumped in to dispel the rumors that he was in fact a Hollywood actor, not a real Afghan Muslim. Children read poetry. The Koran was recited. And on election day, Siddiqi donned her Afghan flag chador and voted. It was a strange day. The turnout in Nangarhar, as elsewhere, was very low. One Afghan woman I met, who worked for an N.G.O., told me that when she tried to urge women to decide for themselves, not to be under the influence of their men, they told her, ''Why shouldn't we listen to our husbands and brothers? You are a kafir'' -- an infidel -- ''you've been with all these foreigners so long!'' A woman who was voting for Siddiqi explained, ''My owner told me to.'' ''Your owner?'' I asked. ''Yes. Mullah Abdul Rahim. Our husband is our owner.'' Early returns showed Siddiqi, Khogiani, Barakzai and Rocketi all headed for Parliament. Although the returns were incomplete, initial counts even had Siddiqi ahead of Hazrat Ali. A few days after the elections, I drove out of Jalalabad along the Kunar River through acres of brown sea-turtle-size stones that gave way to unexpectedly lush fields. I was looking for the father of Khalida, a young woman I'd met in a hospital. She had thrown kerosene from a lamp upon herself, lighted a match and tried to die. She was reed-thin, with burns from her face to her toes. She had little feeling left. But she was upset by what she saw in the little mirror her sister gave her. She wanted to speak and managed to get a few words out in spurts: ''My father is an old man''; ''We are poor''; ''I have two little brothers, one is mad''; ''My husband was 35, and he was good to me at first.'' She was 15 when they were married. Her price was small -- 50,000 rupees, just under $1,000. For whatever reason, perhaps poverty, perhaps jealousy or frustration, her in-laws began to beat her while her husband was away working as a driver in Saudi Arabia. They complained to her husband that she was doing bad work -- and when he returned to their home, he began to beat her, too. After five years, with a 3-year-old daughter, she couldn't bear it any longer. ''That day my father-in-law hit my head with a brick''; she crawled away and found the kerosene lamp. When her father-in-law discovered her, he kept her for some 20 days on a bed without a mattress next to the cows. The filth and the flies infected her wounds. Her suffering and her story, told in the stifling heat of the hospital, was like so many others and would end, a week later, with her death. In his collection of women's landays, the poet Majrouh wrote that in the face of a life of perpetual inferiority and humiliation -- ''even her husband does not stoop so low as to eat with her'' -- what is the Pashtun woman's reaction? Submission. Duties performed like clockwork. Acceptance and suffering. ''Yet,'' he wrote, ''if one takes a slightly closer look, it turns out that in her innermost self the Pashtun woman is indignant and skeptical, feeding her rebellion. From this deep-seated and hidden protest that grows more resistant with every passing day, she comes out with only two forms of evidence in the end -- her suicide and her song.'' He wrote that the tribal code of honor considers suicide a cowardly act, and the Pashtun male will never resort to it. In his time the two methods women used were poison or drowning. Today, Sharifa Shahab, a tireless young woman from the Afghanistan Independent Human Rights Commission, who has worked in Herat, Kabul and now Jalalabad, has found that women tend to choose poison or self-immolation. It was Majrouh's conviction that the songs of Afghan women challenge the society in a similar way as their suicides, by glorifying three themes that taste of blood -- love, honor and death. ''By eliminating herself in such an accursed way,'' he wrote, ''a woman thus tragically proclaims her hatred of the community's law.'' I don't know what exactly I hoped to find by tracking down Khalida's father out in his wind-swept village. He was a short way from the cemetery where he buried his daughter and, before that, his mad son, whom Khalida never knew was dead. Certainly I did not expect the depth of the man's wretchedness. ''I thought a mullah'' -- Khalida's father-in-law -- ''would be a good person to take care of my daughter,'' he said. ''I was wrong. He had no sympathy.'' He wept so hard I thought his fragile frame would snap. What I did find in this man, who had spent most of his life as a shoe-mender in Pakistan and now, in his old age, would often travel the eight hours to Kabul to seek work in the bazaar as a laborer, was precisely what Majrouh had surmised lay in the innermost self of the Pashtun woman -- a wild rage and hatred of the community's law. I also found a surprising belief that telling the story of his daughter's demise and her in-laws' malevolence might somehow help prevent such things from happening again and prevent Khalida's husband from getting another wife. What the father wanted was justice. He didn't know how a jirga -- the assembly of elders who settle disputes -- could deliver that, given the many months that his in-laws, who were also his cousins, had been able to get away with torturing his daughter. ''By the human rights commission,'' he said, ''we will find them and bring them to court.'' Sharifa Shahab has less faith than Khalida's grieving father that the government will be the place to resolve the issues of abuse of women. As she said to me one night: ''How can we trust the government to do anything when all the warlords are in government? Dostum'' -- an indestructible warlord from Mazar-i-Sharif -- ''burned my house down during the civil war because my father was against the Communists. Ismail Khan'' -- formerly governor of Herat, still power broker there and minister of water and power -- ''had his men assault my son because I tried to set up a women's council without his permission. Khalili'' -- Abdul Karim Khalili, currently a vice president -- ''captured all my father's lands. And in Jalalabad, I had an official letter that we are sure is from the old governor saying I better leave Jalalabad because I was trying to change the religion of the people by working on women's issues.'' And then Shahab told me the story of two wives who were recently killed. Two men exchanged their sisters so they could avoid the high price of a proper bride. One of the men killed his wife the first night, accusing her of having had sexual relations before marriage. When the news arrived in the other village, the other man brought his wife -- the other man's sister -- and made her walk around the grave; he cut her hands and feet off and killed her on the grave of the other girl. ''Why? I asked him, and he said, 'He killed my sister; I had to,' '' Shahab told me. ''The government forgave the murderers because the jirga forgave them, and the jirga is higher than the law.'' So she will not wait for the government or any electoral miracle to intervene. Instead, she's creating women's jirgas, using Afghan traditions to bring about change. ''Otherwise, I am totally alone here,'' she said.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"," is a contributing writer for the magazine. She has reported extensively from ,  and, most recently, .  After bumping along five hours of potholes and rock-strewn mountain switchbacks on the main commercial artery from  to  early last month, I was surprised as we entered the  Valley to see an enormous campaign poster, the size of a Times Square billboard, featuring not the boyish face of  -- 's most famous ex-warlord and a parliamentary candidate -- but that of Safia . It's striking enough that a woman would appear so boldly in such a poster in a city where women still do not appear in public without a burka -- more striking still that she was wrapped in a shawl made from the green, black and red of the  flag. These colorful, patriotic images of  also loomed over the streets of  itself, offering a lush kind of hope for its residents. But  is still a place dominated by , the customary law that regulates life throughout the Pashtun belt (the eastern and southern half of istan). The Pashtun code is based on the values of honor, sanctuary, solidarity, shame and revenge, and it treats women as property. In such a place, how much difference can a few female politicians really make? Many s question all the fuss over elections, and the $150 million expense, when, after three and a half years of  and international efforts, they still have few roads, unclean water and crumbling schools. And still every 30 minutes an  woman dies in childbirth. The image of  women is easily reduced to stereotypes. At one extreme is the hidden, voiceless, blue-burkaed cloud floating through the dusty streets behind her turbaned man. At the other is the endangered young feminist firing off a tirade against warlords. Both exist, but reality is mostly between the extremes. If nothing else, perhaps women in  -- by law, 68 seats of 249 are reserved for women -- will begin to demolish these caricatures. In her rebelliousness,  reflects a quality of Pashtun women that lives in the poetic memory of eastern and southern istan and was archived in a small book of women's poetry collected and edited by , one of istan's most revered modern poets. A dean of literature at , a former governor of , , at age 59 in 1988, was assassinated in , , where the various mujahedeen factions fighting the  were based. Shortly before his murder,  went through refugee camps in  to collect landays: simple two-line cries of emotion, usually recited by women to women at the river or the well or at wedding parties. They are physical and brutal, passionate and direct. One that was recited to me on a few occasions last month was almost a threat to the beloved. It shows how embedded is the tribal sense of honor for both men and women: ''If you do not have a wound in the center of your chest/I shall remain indifferent, even if your back is riddled like a sieve with holes.'' The women who composed and shared these poems,  wrote, ''feel repressed, scorned and thought of as second-rate human beings. From the cradle on, they are received with sadness and shame.. . .The father who learns of such an unwelcome arrival seems to go into mourning, whereas he gives a party and fires off a salvo of gunshots at the birth of a boy. Later, and without ever being consulted, the little girl becomes monetary exchange between families of the same clan.'' , in exile among the hostile mujahedeen, seemed to identify with the anguish of Pashtun women. And he identified with their means of defiance -- the landays. They could be cries of despair: ''Cruel people, who see how an old man leads me to his bed/And you ask why I weep and tear out my hair!'' They could also be bold and desirous: ''Give me your hand, my love, and let us go into the fields/So we can love each other or fall together beneath the blows of knives.'' Safia  has taken the boldness of the landays into both in politics and poetry. At a reading last year in , attended more by men than women, she read from a poem of hers called ''I Am Telling the Truth.'' In it the poet addresses her lover, saying she wants to ''smother you with kisses/To put you in the swing of my lap/And to cover you/With the wings of my hair.''  has always enjoyed the spotlight and ached when it dimmed. She was born to a family of judges and religious scholars. Reared in the village of , just outside , she was taught at home and in  classes next door at the corner mosque. The Soviet invasion destroyed 's village tranquillity, and the family was uprooted to .  began tailoring at night near her house to supplement her father's reduced income. By 11th grade she had published a poetry collection, ''Veil,'' in which the chador became a metaphor for protection not just from strange men but also from the Soviet invaders.  went to law school and was energized by the artistic and intellectual life of the university. ''It was the peak time for women's liberty,'' she told me. It all ended abruptly. The Communists were pressuring people like her to join the party. ''They were afraid of me at my college,'' she said. ''My education. My books.'' Her father decided to send the family to . ''And there I was accused by the Islamists of being a Communist,'' she said. ''They wanted to kill me. It was 's party'' -- the Hezb-i-Islami, led by Gulbuddin  -- ''with those women in Saudi black burkas. And I hate those black burkas to this day.'' Yet she had to wear one herself. In , she had no name, no degree, no poetry. She was just a poor refugee, and it made her crazy. She began to work at an entry-level job for an N.G.O., forced herself to learn English and rose in the ranks. Prominence attracted more threats, particularly from the  after they captured  in 1996. She wrote poetry of angry self-assertion and exploration. ''Who am I?'' begins one poem. ''Am I a nomad?. . . No I'm not a nomad, nor a refugee/ They are much better than me.''  also wrote: ''When I'm walking down the street, the people watch me/Disrespectfully and surprisingly/Watch me,/They are talking and saying/'Who is this lout?/Who is she?/Whose daughter is she?/Whose sister is she?/Whose wife is she?' Oh! , is it honor?'' ''We had such a bad life in  as educated women because they never accepted our raising our voice,'' she told me. She formed a small group of activist women and eventually emigrated to , where she met -- quite late by  standards -- her husband, , an artist and journalist. He cuts an unusual figure in the  landscape in his goth get-up: black wool pakool, black tunic, black baggy trousers, black shoes and long black hair. He's in charge of 's security, and he is paranoid, with good reason. Already last year, when she and Safi were consulting for the Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and Development,  was attacked in a tough tribal region. Now that she was campaigning, she would have to go back. At the end of 2001, just after the  scattered from their i stronghold, I received a strange proposal from Mullah Abdul Salaam, known as Rocketi, a neckless barrel of a  commander. He was hiding in a remote village in Zabul, a province of sand dunes, camels and abandoned mud forts, peopled by suspicious men with thick kohl painted around their eyes and a taste for burning down girls' schools. Rocketi was wanted by the s. He had been the  corps commander of  -- not because he was in love with the  but because all he really knew how to do was wage jihad and fire rockets (thus the nickname). He showed me his Stinger missiles, stashed away in a barn, and asked me to help him deliver them to the s in exchange for amnesty. I told him it was impossible. The next day he was forced to trust a man he didn't trust, Ismail Gailani, who is from one of the most respected religious families in istan. Rocketi tried to hide out in the mountains for a time but eventually landed in an -run prison. That is why I was so surprised when I found him in  this summer, in a fine black tunic and a long silver-and-black turban, on his way to the  television studios to record a campaign ad for himself. He was running for , he said, on a simple platform: ''I say that I love all God's people.'' That's it? ''If you promise a lot and do a little, that is not delicious,'' he told me. ''But if you promise a little and do a lot, it will be very, very delicious.'' His smile soon turned to a frown, however, as he contemplated his chief misfortune: ''No matter how much I respect humanity and how great a person I am, my name still misrepresents me.'' Yet despite, or perhaps because of, his nickname, Rocketi's chances for winning a seat in  were excellent. The istan Independent Human Rights Commission tried to force the adoption of an affidavit whereby candidates would have to pledge that they were never involved in any war crimes or drug dealing. ''It was never included,'' said Ahmad Nader Nadery, one of the commission's more outspoken members, when I went to see him shortly after meeting Rocketi. ''All that was left in the affidavit is that 'you are not in an armed group now.' '' So any commanders under suspicion simply turned in some weapons. Ultimately just a few dozen candidates were disqualified on the basis of arms. Nadery said that although warlords are a small proportion of the candidates, they were overshadowing the process. Which makes sense. Who, after all, has been running istan for the past 25 years? Many s understandably wonder whether such elections aren't intended to show ''progress'' in nation building -- and give the United States a way out. On the western outskirts of , in a neighborhood still scarred by the mujahedeen rockets that tore apart  during the civil war 10 years ago, Shukria Barakzai stepped from a silver Mercedes to greet a few dozen women waiting for her in the garden of a neighborhood elder. Though she's one of 's higher-profile women -- she started a newspaper called Women's Mirror shortly after the  fell and often appears on political talk shows in bright, translucent headscarves and high-heeled, pointy pink or ivory shoes -- on this day she had the air of a schoolgirl breaking taboos. A few days earlier, at the official start of campaign season, she took an unprecedented move for  women and went wading through a crowded bazaar to address men and women, shopkeepers and taxi drivers and the police. She was thrilled by it. She also must have enjoyed the fact that it irritated her husband, and that there was nothing he could do about it. Like an  version of a Tracy-Hepburn movie, both Barakzai and her husband were running for . And the tension was palpable between them -- two years ago, when she was battling warlords as a delegate to the loya jirga, or grand assembly, convened to agree on a constitution, she heard that he had taken a second wife. Her friends at women's organizations wanted to take to the streets to protest the laws that allow men to take up to four wives. Barakzai refused. She decided to ride out the change, instead, and in the process grow more familiar with the lives of ordinary  women. During the campaign she mocked her husband's tactics. As a millionaire, she said, ''he doesn't have to do anything except have big lunches for people in trade halls.'' (He made his fortune as an exporter.) She teased that he liked it that way because he is uncomfortable with public speaking. So, unlike Shukria -- who had not hung up any posters yet, preferring radio and TV appearances and the woman-on-the-street approach -- her husband had his team plaster a photograph of himself in a suit and tie, with a horse as his voting emblem, all over the trees and billboards and shop windows of . The women waiting to hear Barakzai beneath the grapevine canopies were illiterate. The neighborhood still had no power, no roads and no buses to take anyone to work if there was any work to be had. The odor of open sewage wafted through the streets and gardens. Some women told Barakzai that their husbands wouldn't let them get their voting-registration cards. One said to me, ''This is istan, and the men are rotten-natured,'' and a chorus of laughter ensued. Unimaginable cruelty had been meted out in this neighborhood just 10 years ago. The women remembered it vividly. One woman had lost 17 members of her family. These women were mystified that the same people who ''fried us in oil and pounded nails in our heads'' were in power, running for . Even worse, said one woman with a laugh, ''people will vote for them.'' Barakzai told them to vote for women instead. Otherwise, ''the Mujahedeen leaders will suffocate us,'' she said. ''But they won't be able to oppress you with a strong female voice in the .'' This was campaign-trail chatter, though; in private, she admitted that everything depended on the quality of the women elected. Many female candidates were put up by husbands whose records, even by Rocketi standards, were too tarnished. Others were put up by the Islamist parties. Barakzai hauled herself up onto the bed of a pickup and addressed a crowd of young men. When one of them told me he was going to vote for the mullah Sayyaf because he had served his country all these years, an old woman from behind the mesh of her burka said: ''Oh, you're a good one. We're waiting like beggars for wheat because of the service of people like him.'' Having lived through the civil war, through  rule, through the complicated compromises she observed and participated in as a delegate to the constitutional loya jirga, Barakzai was realistic about the composition of  society. And she was realistic about an  policy that still supported the old commanders in the belief that inclusion was the best way to preserve stability in istan. ''Of course, 75 percent of our  will be commanders and drug lords,'' she told me. ''But, on the other hand, it's a kind of pluralism of the last three decades. And some people say it's better they are all coming together.'' When a news report said that U.S. soldiers were desecrating the  at Guantanamo, thousands of enraged men marched through 's streets, torched government buildings, the i consulate and foreign aid agencies, chanted ''death to America'' and burned an effigy of President Bush. In the parliamentary campaign, this same spirit manifested itself in a political allergy to the rhetoric of human rights, women's rights and all Western-sounding values. Anti-human-rights rhetoric also makes for good old-fashioned politicking, the kind that easily rouses the emotions of men, reminding them of the simpler days of jihad against the Soviets, when the mujahedeen were somehow heroes of both the Islamic and the Western worlds, and even seen as fighting for human rights -- not as war criminals or the followers of war criminals. At a sunbaked rally for the ex-commander , a white-haired, long-bearded blind mullah energized the crowd when he took to the podium and began cursing human rights. ''The  says women cannot ask for divorce,'' he cried, ''whereas human rights say women should ask for divorce! In the name of human rights we are told to release fornicators and thieves from prison. We know anyone who steals should have his hand cut off. Human rights says, 'No.' You should vote for someone who can fight all those who want to bring human rights law in Islamic law. We need a Moses to save us, and that is .'' A great rumbling and clapping ensued. The women of  understand the mentality they are up against. Safia  and her leading female rival, Saima Khogiani, do not pepper their speeches with talk of women's rights or changing traditions. They speak of the honor of the Pashtun woman, and of how the Pashtuns respect their women. They warn the men of the dangers of succumbing to the bribes of old warlords and rich, lying candidates. They offer the service of their clean past. And they play on the pride of the Pashtun. When I first met Saima Khogiani, a 34-year-old former schoolteacher, she was sitting cross-legged, curled over herself, on the floor of the crumbling i house she'd rented for her campaign offices. She peered at me from beneath the brown embroidery of a black wool scarf. She was rough and defensive, armored with a sardonic smirk. Khogiani faced the ire of her local mullahs when she first decided to run for office. Her uncles wouldn't speak to her. But she insisted and -- despite the curse of one mullah, who warned that the people would be sending 12 generations of their ancestors to hell if they voted for her -- the men were turning up to check her out and offer support in return for assistance. She had a small army of some 15 male cousins who stayed with her and decided where she could campaign. She was the only woman in the entire family who was allowed to meet with men. ''This one,'' a cousin said, pointing to Khogiani's gregarious young niece, ''will be banned from the men's room in two years.'' The young niece pouted. Then she said she didn't care because she was going to become a doctor. But at a campaign stop up in the mountains, in a settlement of salmon-colored mud-and-straw houses, the women were uninterested in women's rights. After reciting a landay about perpetual poverty, one woman was urged by the others to tell Khogiani about their opium problem. ''We know it's not good for istan, but it solved all our problems,'' she said. ''It grows in drought, with almost no water. And it sells for a good price.'' The men vowed that they would plant poppies again this autumn, even under the threat of death. As Khogiani said, ''The people lost their poppy, and the s and the government have not fulfilled their promises of an alternative-livelihoods program.'' The United States Agency for International Development has begun financing short-term projects -- like clearing ditches -- that local communities would have done anyway. It is not a true alternative, and while the farmers will lose their opium income, the governors, police chiefs and smugglers will simply traffic in opium grown elsewhere. After returning to istan, Safia , like Shukria Barakzai, was a delegate to the constitutional loya jirga, where she spoke up to defend a young woman who had condemned the jihadis for their crimes against ordinary s -- then, for the sake of peace, urged the same young woman to apologize.  understands politics well, as I saw when we drove out to her home district of Surkhab, a 40-minute drive from . The village elders had all gathered in a leafy outdoor meeting ground and dragged along their young men, who could be heard grumbling on the sidelines about how bored they were of political campaigns.  appealed to them as Pashtuns, pressing them not to accept money or food in exchange for their votes. She appealed to the male elders, recognizing the suffering of their community and the uselessness of succumbing to warlords. She was in the village of her uncles and cousins. They all knew her father, knew that she's the daughter of a judge. This was a village still without television, where all the children gather at night to hear an elder tell them the love story of Saiful Maluk, son of the king, and Badri Jamal, a fairy girl. The story can take three nights or longer. When  invoked the elders, she was signaling that she understood that they will decide who gets the votes; most likely it would be her. This is how politics works in the countryside.  wrapped up her speech with another effort at tribal bonding: ''You and I are Pashtuns. We appreciate and respect women more than the others. And I will not be able to talk as freely to others as I do to you.'' Still, when she did speak to others -- for example, educated women in  at the government's Department of Public Works -- her tone was markedly different. ''Our men are uneducated,'' she told them. ''Our women don't have jobs. And when you go out, everyone stares at you. If you remove your chador, everyone will call you a bad woman. The girl who should go to school is getting tailoring education because she has to make money for her family. Our kids should go to school, have teachers even at home. Should we vote for someone who intimidates or stops women from going to school? They want to make us scared of everything so we stay at home and out of politics. But we want to help the culture. Who was Malalai?''  was referring to the 19th-century Pashtun heroine who braved British guns to raise the  flag. ''She was a woman. A hero of our country. The reason we don't have any other Malalai is because we have people who won't allow us to go to school.'' As if on cue, a teacher interrupted and said: ''Prove to us that the rights of men and women are the same in Islam. Because the men are saying: 'Don't vote for women. It's not ic. It's only the command of Bush's wife, Laura, that women are candidates.' '' A few days later,  made the mistake of accepting an invitation to the most remote region of Khogiani, Saima Khogiani's tribal base. It's a place of lurking , where roadside bombs are now commonplace and people joke that the women have to do most of the work because the men are all hiding from blood feuds.  delivered her speech to hundreds. Then, just as they were rolling out of the village, rockets and grenades and rifle fire hit her convoy. A few of the police officers in the leading car were wounded.  lay with her brother on the ground and then walked for hours to escape from the village. Yet a week later, when most of the female candidates were lying low, ordered by their families to campaign only at home by receiving visitors,  rallied for one last splashy trip through the bazaar of . In a coasting S.U.V. she popped out of the sunroof and addressed the crowd through a loudspeaker. Men followed her progress in mild horror. ''Look at this cow out of the car,'' one shopkeeper said. ''Isn't she ashamed to wander through the bazaar?'' another said. But no, she wasn't, and as she passed though Pashtunistan Square she confronted the people of Nangarhar with her promises and her questions. ''This was the second attack that happened to me here'' -- the first was last year. ''Did I kill someone? Did I steal something? Are my hands red with blood? Why did you take the weapon to kill me? It is not in our culture to kill a woman without reason.'' She thanked the crowd for their support. Then her husband jumped in to dispel the rumors that he was in fact a Hollywood actor, not a real  Muslim. Children read poetry. The  was recited. And on election day,  donned her  flag chador and voted. It was a strange day. The turnout in Nangarhar, as elsewhere, was very low. One  woman I met, who worked for an N.G.O., told me that when she tried to urge women to decide for themselves, not to be under the influence of their men, they told her, ''Why shouldn't we listen to our husbands and brothers? You are a kafir'' -- an infidel -- ''you've been with all these foreigners so long!'' A woman who was voting for  explained, ''My owner told me to.'' ''Your owner?'' I asked. ''Yes. Mullah Abdul Rahim. Our husband is our owner.'' Early returns showed , Khogiani, Barakzai and Rocketi all headed for . Although the returns were incomplete, initial counts even had  ahead of . A few days after the elections, I drove out of  along the Kunar River through acres of brown sea-turtle-size stones that gave way to unexpectedly lush fields. I was looking for the father of Khalida, a young woman I'd met in a hospital. She had thrown kerosene from a lamp upon herself, lighted a match and tried to die. She was reed-thin, with burns from her face to her toes. She had little feeling left. But she was upset by what she saw in the little mirror her sister gave her. She wanted to speak and managed to get a few words out in spurts: ''My father is an old man''; ''We are poor''; ''I have two little brothers, one is mad''; ''My husband was 35, and he was good to me at first.'' She was 15 when they were married. Her price was small -- 50,000 rupees, just under $1,000. For whatever reason, perhaps poverty, perhaps jealousy or frustration, her in-laws began to beat her while her husband was away working as a driver in . They complained to her husband that she was doing bad work -- and when he returned to their home, he began to beat her, too. After five years, with a 3-year-old daughter, she couldn't bear it any longer. ''That day my father-in-law hit my head with a brick''; she crawled away and found the kerosene lamp. When her father-in-law discovered her, he kept her for some 20 days on a bed without a mattress next to the cows. The filth and the flies infected her wounds. Her suffering and her story, told in the stifling heat of the hospital, was like so many others and would end, a week later, with her death. In his collection of women's landays, the poet  wrote that in the face of a life of perpetual inferiority and humiliation -- ''even her husband does not stoop so low as to eat with her'' -- what is the Pashtun woman's reaction? Submission. Duties performed like clockwork. Acceptance and suffering. ''Yet,'' he wrote, ''if one takes a slightly closer look, it turns out that in her innermost self the Pashtun woman is indignant and skeptical, feeding her rebellion. From this deep-seated and hidden protest that grows more resistant with every passing day, she comes out with only two forms of evidence in the end -- her suicide and her song.'' He wrote that the tribal code of honor considers suicide a cowardly act, and the Pashtun male will never resort to it. In his time the two methods women used were poison or drowning. Today, Sharifa Shahab, a tireless young woman from the istan Independent Human Rights Commission, who has worked in Herat,  and now , has found that women tend to choose poison or self-immolation. It was 's conviction that the songs of  women challenge the society in a similar way as their suicides, by glorifying three themes that taste of blood -- love, honor and death. ''By eliminating herself in such an accursed way,'' he wrote, ''a woman thus tragically proclaims her hatred of the community's law.'' I don't know what exactly I hoped to find by tracking down Khalida's father out in his wind-swept village. He was a short way from the cemetery where he buried his daughter and, before that, his mad son, whom Khalida never knew was dead. Certainly I did not expect the depth of the man's wretchedness. ''I thought a mullah'' -- Khalida's father-in-law -- ''would be a good person to take care of my daughter,'' he said. ''I was wrong. He had no sympathy.'' He wept so hard I thought his fragile frame would snap. What I did find in this man, who had spent most of his life as a shoe-mender in  and now, in his old age, would often travel the eight hours to  to seek work in the bazaar as a laborer, was precisely what  had surmised lay in the innermost self of the Pashtun woman -- a wild rage and hatred of the community's law. I also found a surprising belief that telling the story of his daughter's demise and her in-laws' malevolence might somehow help prevent such things from happening again and prevent Khalida's husband from getting another wife. What the father wanted was justice. He didn't know how a jirga -- the assembly of elders who settle disputes -- could deliver that, given the many months that his in-laws, who were also his cousins, had been able to get away with torturing his daughter. ''By the human rights commission,'' he said, ''we will find them and bring them to court.'' Sharifa Shahab has less faith than Khalida's grieving father that the government will be the place to resolve the issues of abuse of women. As she said to me one night: ''How can we trust the government to do anything when all the warlords are in government? Dostum'' -- an indestructible warlord from Mazar-i-Sharif -- ''burned my house down during the civil war because my father was against the Communists. Ismail Khan'' -- formerly governor of Herat, still power broker there and minister of water and power -- ''had his men assault my son because I tried to set up a women's council without his permission. Khalili'' -- Abdul Karim Khalili, currently a vice president -- ''captured all my father's lands. And in , I had an official letter that we are sure is from the old governor saying I better leave  because I was trying to change the religion of the people by working on women's issues.'' And then Shahab told me the story of two wives who were recently killed. Two men exchanged their sisters so they could avoid the high price of a proper bride. One of the men killed his wife the first night, accusing her of having had sexual relations before marriage. When the news arrived in the other village, the other man brought his wife -- the other man's sister -- and made her walk around the grave; he cut her hands and feet off and killed her on the grave of the other girl. ''Why? I asked him, and he said, 'He killed my sister; I had to,' '' Shahab told me. ''The government forgave the murderers because the jirga forgave them, and the jirga is higher than the law.'' So she will not wait for the government or any electoral miracle to intervene. Instead, she's creating women's jirgas, using  traditions to bring about change. ''Otherwise, I am totally alone here,'' she said.  URL: http://www.nytimes.com"
"NYT",1999,"Germany","WOMEN'S WORLD CUP; The Other Steffi (Jones) On Defense for Germany","Under different circumstances, Steffi Jones might have found herself in the American lineup for Thursday's quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup, instead of anchoring the German defense. Tens of thousands of fans might have been cheering for her team, not against it. Perhaps she, too, could be riding a tidal wave of popularity instead of trying to sustain a ripple of interest back home. But, really, there are no regrets. Her father, a former American serviceman named Ray Jones, left the family when Steffi was 4 and she was reared by her German mother, Lilo, in Frankfurt. She did not meet her father until she was 21, and he is more like a friend than a father, she said. They are speaking frequently by phone during the World Cup and he has watched her play on television. If Germany keeps advancing, maybe he will attend a match, she said, but, for now, he lives in San Antonio and is tethered to his job. When Jones began playing soccer at age 4 in Frankfurt, it was with boys. Not until she was 14 did she even know that there were teams for girls in Germany. At 18, she had to make a choice. Should she attempt to make the American national team or play for Germany? For someone who had lived her whole life in Germany, it was an easy decision. ""My dad never called,"" she said. ""I didn't know him too well. There's no sense becoming a U.S. citizen if you don't know anyone there. I'm proud to play for the German national team."" At 5 feet 11 inches, Jones is a rangy defender who possesses sufficient skill to move forward and score, which she did in a 3-3 draw with Brazil on Sunday. In 1997, Jones was named the most valuable defensive player in the European championships, which Germany won. Tony DiCicco, coach of the American women, said he might have been interested in Jones, who is 26, but added: ""We never knew about her until she played against us. By then it was too late."" Thursday's match at Jack Kent Cooke Stadium in Landover, Md., is urgent in both the short term and long term for women's soccer in Germany. One of the eight quarterfinalists in the Women's World Cup will not qualify for the 2000 Summer Olympics in Sydney because Australia, as the host team, has an automatic bid. Losing badly to the Americans could knock the Germans out, puncturing the bubble of interest in women's soccer at home. Even though Germany finished second to Norway at the 1995 Women's World Cup, interest in the women amounts to a sliver of the interest in the men's team, which has won three world championships. While the United States-North Korea match was televised live in the middle of the night to Germany on Sunday, the more engaging Germany-Brazil match was shown on tape delay, team officials said. Only one of Germany's major newspapers sent a reporter to cover the Women's World Cup, according to Willi Hink, the head of the women's division of the national soccer federation. The country's most popular soccer magazine virtually ignores the women, he said. ""If we don't beat the U.S.A., I think everything will be forgotten in three weeks,"" Hink said. Even if the Germans win, he said: ""Many people don't understand that the U.S.A. is the leading team in women's soccer. They say, 'U.S.A., they can't play soccer.' "" The women's game was largely dismissed in Germany until 1989, Hink said, when goalkeeper Marion Isbert scored the decisive goal in a penalty kick shootout against Italy in the semifinals of the European championships. Her picture made the front page of the country's largest-selling newspaper, Hink said, and she became a national hero. Participation among girls and women has risen to approximately 800,000, compared with 7.5 million in the United States. The German women's league, which some consider to be the best in the world, operates with 12 teams on a semiprofessional basis. Two years ago, Hink said, the national cup championship, played as a doubleheader with the men's cup, drew 76,000 in Berlin. The top female players in Germany can earn up to $50,000 a year with salaries and endorsements, though most earn far less, officials said. The top clubs also offer free cars and apartments to their star players. Some players also coach, while others attend school, serve in the Army or hold part-time jobs -- Jones is a clerk -- that allow them freedom to train up to nine times a week. The former East Germany did not emphasize women's soccer, and its national team played only one match before the Berlin Wall fell, Hink said. Several eastern Germans joined the unified national team, he said, but ""the pressure was so bad, they couldn't stand it. They weren't used to so much training."" The current German team is typically well-organized, but lacks overall speed. It was also unable to hold a lead against Brazil after Jones provided a 3-2 margin in the 58th minute. The captain, Martina Voss, is out with a leg injury. But Jones steadies the defense, midfielder Bettina Wiegmann is a threat on free kicks and penalty kicks, goalkeeper Silke Rottenberg is one of the world's best and forward Birgit Prinz gives the team a toughness it was previously lacking. ""I think the Americans have the better players and the better team,"" Coach Tina Theune-Meyer said. ""But we can play fast and I think we can set their defense under pressure."" The larger question is whether the German defense can withstand the pressure of an American attack that has scored 13 goals in three matches. ""We had a great second half against Brazil,"" Jones said. ""If we play like that, we don't have to hide."" http://www.nytimes.com","Under different circumstances,   might have found herself in the American lineup for Thursday's quarterfinals of the Women's World Cup, instead of anchoring the German defense.
